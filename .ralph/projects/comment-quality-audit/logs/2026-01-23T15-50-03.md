# Task: Verify solid-view.ts: Run solid-view tests

## Attempt: 1
## Status: SUCCESS

## What I Did
- Ran the solid-view tests using vitest to verify the comment changes made in previous tasks

## Files Changed
- (none, verification only)

## Verification Output
```
RUN v4.0.15 /Users/alp/experiments/rocicorp-mono

 ✓ zero-solid (chromium) src/solid-view.test.ts (15 tests) 17ms

 Test Files  1 passed (1)
      Tests  15 passed (15)
   Start at  10:49:58
   Duration  838ms (transform 0ms, setup 0ms, import 196ms, tests 17ms, environment 0ms)
```

All 15 tests passed. The stderr warnings about "computations created outside a `createRoot` or `render`" are expected test behavior (tests create signals outside of a render context).
