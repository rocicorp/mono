## Status: SUCCESS

## What I Did

- Verified all 15 tests pass

## Files Changed
- (none - verification only)

## Verification Output
```
 ✓ zero-solid (chromium) src/solid-view.test.ts (15 tests) 14ms

 Test Files  1 passed (1)

## Notes
- Some stderr warnings about "computations created outside a `createRoot` or `render` will never be disposed" appear but these are expected in test contexts and don't cause test failures
