# Task: Verify solid-view.ts: Run solid-view tests

## Attempt: 1
## Status: SUCCESS

## What I Did
- Ran solid-view tests with `npx vitest run packages/zero-solid/src/solid-view.test.ts`
- All tests passed, confirming the comment changes don't break functionality

## Files Changed
- (none, verification only)

## Verification Output
```
 ✓ zero-solid (chromium) src/solid-view.test.ts (15 tests) 20ms

 Test Files  1 passed (1)
      Tests  15 passed (15)
   Start at  10:52:56
   Duration  886ms
```

## Notes
- Some stderr warnings about "computations created outside a `createRoot` or `render` will never be disposed" appeared, but these are expected Solid.js warnings in test environments and don't indicate failures
