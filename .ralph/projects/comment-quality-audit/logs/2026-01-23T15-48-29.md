# Task: Fix React.memo reference in solid-view.ts

## Attempt: 1
## Status: SUCCESS

## What I Did
- Read solid-view.ts to locate the React.memo reference
- Found it on line 171 in the #applyChanges method comment
- Updated the comment to explain Solid's fine-grained reactivity instead of React.memo

## Files Changed
- packages/zero-solid/src/solid-view.ts (modified)

## Changes Made
Before:
```typescript
// Apply changes immutably, then reconcile into Solid store.
// Unchanged rows keep identity (enables React.memo); reconcile diffs by
// idSymbol and updates only changed properties for fine-grained reactivity.
```

After:
```typescript
// Build new tree immutably, then reconcile() diffs by idSymbol.
// Solid's fine-grained reactivity only triggers signals for changed properties.
```

## Why This Change
- React.memo is a React concept that doesn't apply to Solid.js
- Solid uses fine-grained reactivity with signals, not component memoization
- The comment now correctly explains why reconcile() is used: to enable Solid's signal-based updates
