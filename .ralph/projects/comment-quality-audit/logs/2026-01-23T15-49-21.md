# Task: Add ASCII viz to solid-view.ts

## Attempt: 1
## Status: SUCCESS

## What I Did
- Read solid-view.ts to understand the update flow and identify where ASCII visualization would add clarity
- Added a class-level ASCII flowchart showing the two-path update strategy:
  - Fast path: builderRoot for bulk inserts from empty state
  - Incremental path: pendingChanges queue for updates to existing data
- The visualization shows how both paths converge at onTransactionCommit and use reconcile() for Solid's fine-grained reactivity

## Files Changed
- packages/zero-solid/src/solid-view.ts (modified)

## Why This Visualization Helps
The SolidView class has a non-obvious optimization: when building from empty, it uses plain JS objects (fast), otherwise it queues changes. Both paths meet at transaction commit. The ASCII diagram makes this branching logic immediately clear without reading implementation details.
