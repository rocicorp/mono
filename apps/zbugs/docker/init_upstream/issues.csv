One item not mentioned there is that we can also re-order where `join` occurs in the data flow graph in order to:
1. Compute a join once and share it among all queries
2. Constrain a join to a subset of the table being joined

These same optimizations apply to correlated sub-queries.

An interesting little bit about sub-queries is that if the sub-query is not used in a `where` or `order-by`, we can completely skip evaluating it until the limited view returns it.

E.g.,
```ts
issue.select(user.select..., title, id).limit(10)
```

We can wait to evaluate the `user.select` until we know the final 10 rows being returned.

2. join changing the nesting level of the results of a query could be problematic. E.g., from `Issue[]` to `{issue: Issue, label: Label}[]` See commit: https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/1640/commits/ac0deea5b64f3a4c50565c1ad11285eabaebf7a7 where the query is changed to join labels and the impact ripples through the app. The commit comment documents a few options.
3. Select changing the return type of a query makes it impossible to re-assign to the same variable after applying select. `q = query; q = q.select('foo') // type error`
4. `Return` being on a type param in the EntityQuery makes it hard to take `EntityQuery` as an arg to a function and error prone when defining filters.
   1. Specifically, if someone fumbles `Return` and/or `FromSet` then they will write unqualified `where` when the `where` requires qualification. The root of the problem is that `{a: any}` is wider than `{a: any, b: any}` and we allow unqalified `where` if the `FromSet` only has a single prop.
5. Because `join` changes generics on the query, having a function that updates the query with new `HAVING` filters (and no selects) can produce an incompatible query. Specifically: https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/1640/commits/183979c6cea435e11d4ab9fca977b412c312fa0c#diff-a275f49b14e8e300928bee76064f80e20e5cba32e36975fda20caa65a395075cR383
   1. We can remove most of this problem by introducing `whereExists`
   2. Maybe a non-joined query should be wider than a joined query in a type sense? So the one with joins can be assigned to the one without?"

I believe there are some cases where collectClientIfDeleted may modify the user values but version does not get updated.

From my reading collectClientIfDeleted, does not itself call putVersion, and prior to this patch relied on its caller to call putVersion.  It does now call callCloseHandler which sometimes calls putVersion, but only if the closeHandler actually modified user values.

So in the case that the above disconnectHandler throws an exception (and thus does not putVersion), the closeHandler does not modify user values, and  collectOldUserSpaceClientKeys is run and deletes some user values, I believe we end up with user values modified but version not updated.

Regarding 

""Another gotcha here is that when we process disconnect we collect the client even if lastMutationId is larger than lastMutationIdAtClose. Intuitively this seems correct but this could use some more thought.""

I think this is correct.  I think the initial assumption was that there can be no mutations from the client with a lastMutationID larger than the one sent it sent in the close beacon, but then you discovered that is not quite true, a client can sneak mutations over the websocket as the page is unloading. If it manages to do this its still correct to collect it when it disconnect.

What would be problematic is if the client:
1. manages to execute mutations after the close beacon
2. does not manage to send them over the websocket
3. but does manage to persist them to idb (via persists)

In this case the server may collect the client, but the client group may later push mutations from that client.  I think the client group might get wedged in this case.  Do you think this is possible?

@grgbkr, is this a situation that is expected?

A more cost effective method is to amortize the cost of the cold start by pre-initializing the function while we're waiting for other things to initialize:

1. For the login page, we can ping `user-ensure` when we show the login form.
2. For cli commands, we can ping the destination function while we're waiting for firebase authentication (creds from `~/.reflect/config/default.json`

U0LjvDThCIoDEYqkjx3gv,Move Firestore writes out of the critical API serving path,false,1705008876000.0,1705002688000.0,darkgnotic,"Every time an app key is used, we update the `lastUsed` timestamp of the key, which is surfaced to the user when they list their keys. This is useful, for example, for knowing when keys are used and which keys are no longer used.

![Screenshot 2024-01-11 at 11 41 49 AM](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/assets/132324914/f69610ba-95b7-459c-b6c2-e4d400c53dc6)

The initial implementation of key authorization performs this Firestore write while authorizing the request. This is fine for manual developer actions like `reflect publish` and `reflect env set|delete`. However, it is less acceptable for actions that affect the actual app runtime, which as API calls.

For example, if we get simultaneous API calls to create or modify (close, delete) 1000 rooms, the calls will bottleneck/serialize at the step where we perform the transactional update of the app key. (And it will incur 1000 Firestore writes when we really only needed one).

Ideally, the update should be done off of the critical path. In fact, the code was written when a [TODO to address this](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/blob/f5f8334dc50c3b9cd9060379aa0102eec700ba25/mirror/mirror-server/src/functions/validators/auth.ts#L257):

```ts
        txn.update(appKeyDocRef, {lastUsed: FieldValue.serverTimestamp()});
        return {app};
      },
      // TODO(darick): Add a mechanism for initiating writes (like the `lastUsed` timestamp update)
      // in the background so as not to delay request processing. Then this Transaction can be readOnly.
      // {readOnly: true},
    );
```

Note that simply delaying the write to happen later in the function is not an option, as cloud functions do not support ""background"" processing; the response is only sent after the returned Promise is resolved, and any unresolved Promises are not guaranteed to complete as the function may be hibernated before hand.

https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/terminate-functions

So to correctly move logic off of the critical path, the logic must be handed off to another process (such as another function).

e769BGw1cVWLswvZrrLn9,Active serving user dashboard Firestore queries,true,1709537194000.0,1704937088000.0,darkgnotic,"## Motivation

[We need an “active serving users” metric](https://www.notion.so/replicache/Reflect-Roadmap-d5a5dfbbf67f4a3a8077804e8250dc06?p=b86657b1edbc49c28e6b984b79563b58&pm=s)

@aboodman 

## Definitions
* An **active team** for a given period (month, day, hour) is one for which there are active room seconds recorded for that team.
* An **active app** can be similarly defined at the scope of an app instead of a team

## Metrics

Room seconds are stored as the `rs` metric in Firestore ([schema](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/blob/7e70ce828b59bce7941bcae94ad293fe110f466e/mirror/mirror-schema/src/metrics.ts#L10)). An example of what these look like can be seen in [ledger.test.ts](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/blob/7e70ce828b59bce7941bcae94ad293fe110f466e/mirror/mirror-server/src/metrics/ledger.test.ts#L364)

## Queries

* For yearly or monthly team totals, query the total metrics docs:

```ts
const query = await getFirestore()
    .collectionGroup('metrics')
    .where('yearMonth', '==', null)
    .where('appID', '==', null)
    .get();
```

From the results you can count the number of documents (i.e. teams) in which there are non-zero `rs` values for each month.

* For yearly or monthly app totals, similarly query:

```ts
const query = await getFirestore()
    .collectionGroup('metrics')
    .where('yearMonth', '==', null)
    .where('appID', '!=', null)
    .get();
```
 
* For daily or hourly team totals, query the monthly metrics docs for the appropriate `yearMonth` value:

```ts
const query = await getFirestore()
    .collectionGroup('metrics')
    .where('yearMonth', '==', 202401)
    .where('appID', '==', null)
    .get();
```

This is structured similarly to the total metrics docs, but instead of a year/month breakdown, the docs will have day/hour breakdowns for the associated month.

* For the per-app equivalent, similarly change the condition of the `appID`:
 
```ts
const query = await getFirestore()
    .collectionGroup('metrics')
    .where('yearMonth', '==', 202401)
    .where('appID', '!=', null)
    .get();
```

## Permissions / setup

The service account `metrics-dashboard@reflect-mirror-prod.iam.gserviceaccount.com` has been created with Firestore read-access. [Create a key](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts/details/116401512738751249544/keys?project=reflect-mirror-prod) for this service account (JSON), download it, and use that to initialize the Firestore client in the dashboard backend.

Note that this key grants read access to all of Firestore and should be considered sensitive. DO NOT check it in to source control. "

The way it happened to me just now:
* run `npx reflect create foo`. This sets everything up to point to `src/reflect/index.ts`
* run `npx reflect publish` to create the server-side app
* delete the app with `npx reflect delete`
* also delete `reflect.config.json`
* now try to revive the app with `npx reflect init`

Unlike `create`, `init` sets up `reflect.config.json` to point to `reflect/index.ts`. I think this may be why we see so many of those `dev` / `ENOENT` errors.

I know `reflect init` is supposed to be in line with the instructions in https://hello.reflect.net/add-to-existing, but it's a bit unfortunate that it's not compatible with the project created by `reflect create`.

Not an emergency, but improving this might reduce some bounce factor.

Maybe have `init` check for the file? Or be even fancier and replace the file path if it's in `src/reflect/index.ts`?

CPx1yvB48SrvgbYUSpkMq,Move secrets out of the App document,false,1699422390000.0,1699234885000.0,darkgnotic,"Currently, app secrets (implemented for #679 and #1150) are stored in encrypted form in the App doc. This makes it convenient for triggering a new deployment when secrets change. However, there are a couple of reasons this is non-ideal:

* We currently limit the number of variables per env to 50 * 5kb secrets, which is ~256kb of data. Each Firestore document stores a maximum of 1MB, so this schema limits the number of environments we can support. And it's better not to load that much data for the App every time we perform an operation on it anyway.
* The App doc is accessible to anyone on the App's ""team"", which means we technically give them unlimited power to generate plaintext / ciphertext pairs. Although the generation includes a random initialization vector that they can't control, it may provide some advantage in brute-forcing the global encryption key. It would be better not to expose the ciphertexts either.

Fix:

* Move app secrets into an app subcollection `envs`, with the default one living in `apps/<appID>/envs/(default)`
* Disallow external read access to the `envs` subcollection.
* In the App doc (or in the future, whatever doc tracks a deployment instance), store the `secretsUpdateTime` in the `DeploymentSpec` and use that to determine when a new deployment in necessary (instead of the current `hashesOfSecrets` field)."

One thing that's puzzling is that the error is coming from `node_modules/miniflare/node_modules/...`. I'm not sure why `fetch` is using that library.

@grgbkr and I have identified one reason this error gets thrown spuriously, which is that when Reflect is `close()`'d, the timer never gets canceled. There is evidence this is happening often in the logs:

* On the one hand, it obviates the need to create and maintain a Cloud Function API for reading data from the store
* On the other hand, it essentially makes the Firestore schema the API for which versioning must be managed instead.

Last week I had forgotten about this and mistakenly removed the required `teamSubdomains` field from the App doc, as the server code was updated to no longer expect it. However, the `reflect-cli` expected it, and the `reflect delete` functionality consequently broke.

There is a yet-to-be-implemented [scheme for handling cli / schema versioning / compatibility](https://www.notion.so/replicache/Mirror-4d1c7f00d95c410299ceecd9311e1560#3ef1f998cefc4c7d97c9c5a8a3e158b8) in which we publish min-supported, max-deprecated, and current versions of the cli, and the cli knows to check these versions before operating. It can prompt the user to upgrade if its own version is deprecated, and refuse to proceed if unsupported. This will allow us to eventually clean up old schemas.

The document proposes maintaining these versions in Firestore, but if the versions do not need to be stack-specific, they could also be dist-tags in npm. `@latest` is already there by default, and we could add `@cli-supported` and `@cli-deprecated` tags.

It take a write lock on the authLock for each request.  If the RoomDO is slow to start up or respond it could cause the AuthDO to get overloaded errors, as all connection requests will be blocked by this write lock on the authLock.  Monday WorkCanvas's AuthDO has had overload errors that may be due to this.

This risk can be reduced by:
1. send a fetch outside the lock to the RoomDO to wake it up, only after its awake take the lock and make the critical fetch that needs to be locked
2. add a timeout to the fetch inside the lock so it can't hold it for more than say 300ms (if we've already woke the RoomDO it should be very fast).

FU2janrOctZZvFLLvMtPs,RFE: A way to subscribe to only keys efficiently,false,1709537043000.0,1694111023000.0,aboodman,"A common pattern in Replicache/Reflect apps is that there is some container (a canvas, a list of todos, etc) and then there are items.

In React, we want to reduce renders. If the container element subscribes to all the elements and passes them down to child components, then any change in a child will cause the container to re-render, which will also cause all the _other_ children to re-render. This can be mitigated somewhat with `React.memo` on the children elements, but this pattern will always result in at least an extraneous re-render of the container for every child change.

Alternately, we could have the container subscribe to only the keys (`useSubscribe(r, async tx => await tx.scan().keys())`). When a child changes, the query will re-run at the container, but it will compute the same keys so the container won't re-render. We still do extraneous work, but less.

If there were a way to subscribe to keys and have Replicache only re-run the query when a key is added/removed, then the second pattern could be implemented perfectly efficiently in React. Replicache would only re-run the query when a child element is added or removed, and the container would only re-render when that happened."

(This is one of the things @aboodman was wondering about). This means that the server module can have unpublished changes that were committed to the repo without a version bump.

Is there a way to have the `mirror-cli` package reference the canonical `@rocicorp/reflect` npm (while still being in the `mono` repo)? I imagine that having multiple instances of a package with the same version can wreak some havoc, but maybe there is some npm-fu that can do this.

Unfortunately, this means that we won't be able to share as much code between the server (Firebase Functions) and client (cli) because the two SDKs are pretty different. And we may need to use the emulator to test stuff on the client side.

To make this more robust we should:

1.  Move the build that generates “version” into “packages/reflect” (though we may run in to some circular dep issues before packages/reflect, packages/reflect-client and packages/reflect-server).
2. Add a prepack script to packages/reflect (and probably other published packages in mono), that ensures that build is run from root, and tests are run, before the pack happens.

However, it does happen all the time during development, when deleting server databases is common. And unlike in Replicache 12 just refreshing doesn't solve it, so this is extremely confusing and frustrating.

I think this blocks releasing Replicache 13, because the behavior is so much worse than 12.

I think that in development mode (when NODE_ENV === ""development""), when Replicache receives `ClientStateNotFound` from the server, it should by default:

1. Delete all local state
2. Refresh app
3. Print an error to the console saying what happened

I think this is very similar to other error paths we have already so it should be easy to reuse.

In production, the current behavior should remain as-is."

Hi,
I'm having an issue with the replicache license status ping from a react-native application. Here's the response I receive:
```
Error sending license active ping: Error: Got 400 fetching https://replicache-license.herokuapp.com/api/1.0/license/active: [
  {
    ""code"": ""invalid_type"",
    ""expected"": ""string"",

    ""received"": ""undefined"",
    ""path"": [
      ""profileID""
    ],
    ""message"": ""Required""
  }
]
```

I have verified that the license key payload is being sent in the request. I can see it in my network request logs, and it matches the body sent from a desktop web browser.
Request body format from logs:
```
{""licenseKey"":""xxx123mylicensestring""}
```
and my headers look ok:
```
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json
```

Furthermore, I have no issues with the same key from a desktop web browser react app. I've compared the request payload and it's identical. 

Are there maybe some additional headers the license server is looking for that the mobile application isn't sending?

I recognize that react-native isn't ""officially"" supported, but I've had success with the TEST_LICENSE_KEY using this helpful package: https://github.com/Braden1996/react-native-replicache

Thanks in advance for any help!"

fGYBYI7icLmn87kHdScAk,Add timestamps to authentication and invalidation protocols,true,1709537485000.0,1685638992000.0,darkgnotic,"Currently, the AuthDO relies on locking and request ordering to avoid one direction of authenticate-invalidate race condition (detailed [here](https://www.notion.so/replicache/Invalidating-Auth-732e9f9abb6a4806b5461c87dfde580f?pvs=4#fc93bf38e9f44bc48aa7d40dd9a678a1)). This can lead to unbounded contention since the `authHandler` can do arbitrary I/O, including calling out to external systems.

The way this race is generally handled in the industry is with timestamps. Each auth token encodes a timestamp, and an invalidation sets a watermark for the earliest valid auth token. (This is how you get logged out of Google properties when you change your Google password). For example, the [decoded contents of a Firebase auth token](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/admin/node/firebase-admin.auth.decodedidtoken) includes an auth_time. 

In reflect, authentication is opaque to us and we rely on the customer's `authHandler` and invalidation request to dictate validity of authentications. As such, we can improve our guarantees without relying on locking and request ordering by adding timestamps to both the response of the `authHandler` and the payload of invalidation requests.

Note that this does involve a protocol change to the customer API, so it should be done in a backwards-compatible manner.

Currently Reflect's `online` state starts out `false` which is pedantically true: we don't yet know whether we're online so from Reflect's POV we're offline.

But from a ux pov this is pretty weird looking. It looks as if something is broken -- you load the app and then see an indicator that it's offline.

The easy thing would be to just default the other way -- (a) Reflect starts out online. A more technically correct and flexible thing would be to (b) add an 'unknown' state which is used only at startup, until the first connect attempt completes.

Note that #498 would also solve this in the sense that user could just wait until `onFirstSync` but (a) this makes it harder to implement the online status UI for our users because they have to string together two APIs, and (b) it unnecessarily delays being able to tell the user the online status (because have to wait for actual pokes to be downloaded and played).

1. `processFrame` does not process one frame
2. What is the distinction be `processPending` (for the roomDO) and `processRoom

Also their is a lot of redundancy in the testing of processPending/processRoom/processFrame.

processPending's responsibilities are

1. identifying idle connections and closing them
2. selecting the next chunk of mutations to process
3. calling processRoom
4. sending pokes

processRoom's responsibilities are:

1. creating fast-forward pokes for any clients that are behind
2. calling processFrame

processFrame's responsibilities are:

1. processing mutations
2. running disconnectHandler
3. creating poke messages for the patches from above mutations and disconnectHandler


We should consider refactoring and renaming things here, possibly something like:

1. processPending is renamed to `processTurn`
2. processTurn calls in turn: `closeIdleClients`, (possibly in the future `processConnects` if we add support for onConnect handlers), `fastForwardStaleClients`, `processMutations`, `processDisconnects` and `sendPokes`.
3. processRoom and processFrame go away.

This refactor is easy except for the tests... its going to be a lot of work to rework the tests.

Two examples:

* In the ALIVE demo, we disconnect when switching away from the tab and reconnect when switching back. When switching back, we display cached data (either persisted, or in memory, doesn't matter) and then a second later first sync happens and the puzzle jumps to a different state -- typically *very* different because the bots have been running around moving things. It would be better ux to just delay display until we get that first sync.

* In Notion, and many other collaborative apps, it's common to display the cached state to allow fast loads, but then hvae a spinner in the corner to let the user know that a background refresh is happening.

For both of these we need some kind of API to let the client know it's gotten up to date with the server.

Dj6LEOA9zuXzoV6c9klaa,Fine-grained write auth,false,1709537612000.0,1683342179000.0,aboodman,"Currently, Reflect supports authentication (who is the currently logged in user) and coarse-grained authorization (can they access this room), but not fine grained authorization (can they access this field? can they modify this field?).

When @grgbkr originally designed auth, there was a feature for the auth handler to return additional ""context"" which could be exposed to mutators and used for write-time authorization decisions.

Our customers frequently ask for the ability to have ""admins"" for certain rooms, who are the only ones allowed to edit. This feature could be used for that. The auth handler could return an additional `isAdmin` flag which the mutator used 

For example, one thing you could do is return a bit which says whether the user is an admin. This bit could then be used by mutators to decide how to function.

This idea is sketched here:

https://www.notion.so/replicache/Reflect-Authentication-Authorization-and-Security-bf2b1a2e31844efca73c4aa453fdecdb?pvs=4#caf5a6970f6345b99170dbb6f7ec0a9e

As a starting point, even exposing the `userID` to the `WriteTransaction` would be useful, as it would enable features like editing your own content but not other users'.

We would have to decide whether to add yet another field to Replicache's `WriteTransaction` that really only makes sense on the server, or to extend a new `ReflectWriteTransaction` that adds this field."

It would be nice to detect this and warn the user.

I do not think we can do the obvious thing, which is to detect user opening a transaction while another is running because it is actually totally legitimate to do that. The problem is not:

- open tx1
- open tx2

It's that in addition to above, tx1 waiting to close for tx2 to close. In that case, we deadlock. But I do not think that is possible for us to detect because we have no way to know *why* tx1 isn't closing.

Instead, what I think we could do is: *if* the user opens a transaction *and* there is already running, then start a timer for say 5 seconds. If the lock hasn't released on 5s, then tell the user there was a deadlock and that they may be executing nested transactions.

XlJCP3zurxQelxQz0MLr7,Questions about connection loop,false,1681480897000.0,1680336011000.0,aboodman,"<s>First, it seems like the ping timeout logic is not correct.

https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/blob/main/packages/reflect/src/client/reflect.ts#L883:

```
// When connected we wait for whatever happens first out of:
// - After PING_INTERVAL_MS we send a ping
// - We get disconnected
// - We get a message
// - The tab becomes hidden (with a delay)
```

ISSUE 1: This seems like it will result in the ping continually getting pushed back 2s on each new message, which might result in us not sending pings for arbitrarily long when the socket is busy. I think I have seen us disconnect due to ping timeout under busy conditions frequently.</s>

This one was incorrect -- I forgot that it's the client that measures ping timeouts, not the server.

===

Stepping back one level, I'm not sure why we wait for a message in the first place? We [await `#nextMessageResolver`](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/blob/main/packages/reflect/src/client/reflect.ts#L898).

In the case it fulfills, we do nothing and the loop repeats (only pushing back the ping). In the case it rejects, we jump to the catch block: https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/blob/main/packages/reflect/src/client/reflect.ts#L922.

There are two cases where `#nextMessageResolver` rejects:
1. handling an invalid server->client message: https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/blob/main/packages/reflect/src/client/reflect.ts#L449. Note that in this case we do *not* disconnect -- the socket stays connected.
2. handling an error message from server: https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/blob/main/packages/reflect/src/client/reflect.ts#L531. In this case we do disconnect.

So that means in the catch block, in the case where `#nextMessageResolver` rejected:

- The error count gets incremented either way: https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/blob/main/packages/reflect/src/client/reflect.ts#L946
- We set ourselves offline and sleep either way: https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/blob/main/packages/reflect/src/client/reflect.ts#L955, even though we did not necessarily disconnect

ISSUE 2: This seems inconsistent to me. If we are telling the app that the connection is offline, we should actually be offline. Also we should not be receiving messages, but I think in this case we continue to.

===

While a ping is running the connection loop is not waiting on `nextMessageResolver`. But messages do continue to be processed during a ping.

ISSUE 3: So this means that in the special case of an an invalid message being received during a ping, it will *not* enter the catch block and have the error handling behavior.

<s>ISSUE 4: Actually we don't listen to visibilityWatcher during ping either. So if it happens while a ping is outstanding we will just miss it and stay connected: https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/blob/main/packages/reflect/src/client/reflect.ts#L898</s> -- this one was also incorrect.

===

Summing up it seems like:

- We could get rid of `#nextMessageResolver` completely. I'm not sure what purpose it has, and I think it is causing many other issues in here. <s>This would immediately fix ISSUE 1.</s> It would also fix ISSUE 2 and ISSUE 3 in that an invalid server message received would not ever trigger the catch block, which is consistent with not closing the connection.
<s>- I think that handling visibility change and disconnecting should happen outside the connection loop. That way it will happen even when a ping is outstanding. This would fix ISSUE 4.</s>"

For this reason I think we should do a ""canary"" https request in parallel with the socket connection and include whether it failed or succeeded in the logs and in the metrics.

For the metrics, it seems like the best thing would be to include it as a ""tag"" in the last_connect_error metric. That way we can easily compute how many of a particular error type have a canary request that is succeeding/failing."

1. `new Reflect()` on client
2. Client calls `auth()` to get a token
3. Server calls `authHandler` to verify token
4. `authHandler` returns the user ID
5. `<connection success>`
6. Your server calls `invalidate*()`
7. server closes relevant connections
8. Client immediately tries to reconnect, using old tokens
9. Server calls `authHandler`
10. `authHandler` throws
11. Server returns auth error to client
12. Client receives auth error and calls `auth()` to get a fresh token
13. Client reconnects, sending new token
14. Server calls `authHandler` to verify token
15. `authHandler` returns `userID`
16. `<connection success>`

In step 7 when the server closes the relevant connection we can send a close code. If that close code is `AuthInvalidated` we call `auth` locally before trying to reconnect. Then the flow would be:

1. `new Reflect()` on client
2. Client calls `auth()` to get a token
3. Server calls `authHandler` to verify token
4. `authHandler` returns the user ID
5. `<connection success>`
6. Your server calls `invalidate*()`
7. server closes relevant connections with `AuthInvalidated` close code.
8. Client receives auth error and calls `auth()` to get a fresh token
9. Client reconnects, sending new token
10. Server calls `authHandler` to verify token
11. `authHandler` returns `userID`
12. `<connection success>`

Reducing the algorithm by 4 steps and removing the extra connection attempt.

The only question is if it is expected that the auth tokens returned in step 2 are generally revoked when a room auth is invalidated. If they are generally not revoked (cron) then there is no need to call `auth` on the client after the disconnect.

gBu2nDQ12xiPyiROFKuTy,RFE: overload subscribe callback with a function,false,1693817777000.0,1678268312000.0,arv,"Subscribe currently have the type:

```ts
export interface SubscribeOptions<R extends ReadonlyJSONValue | undefined> {

I think we need something in the protocol to indicate that mutations being sent were created offline. We'd then either (a) buffer the offline mutations server-side until we have them all and replay in one turn, or (b) process them as normal but tell the receivers to pause motion until replay complete.

(a) has the downside that we will eventually exceed server memory limits. (b) looks ugly but should in many cases actually happen pretty fast and may be the easier tradeoff.

Other options are to store the offline mutations somewhere server-side or maybe to use the socket itself as a queue and just process the mutations from the reconnecting client incrementally as part of the turn processing so that they are never in memory?"

Fritz designed https://www.notion.so/replicache/Reps-v-Smol-Design-Sketch-818bb4a93bd245e48cc0e3b344a2f473 but there is an even more minimal version in progress here: https://www.notion.so/replicache/Reconsidering-SaaS-3aa7ce8bb2e947aeb17bf4220a4be186.

Even as a microsaas, this is a significant amount of work and has several subcomponents:

- Implementing a new service, `mirror`, which manages the deployments of user apps on our service
  - Setting up customer/app storage somewhere on server (either reusing license server or doing something new in CF)
  - Implementing `publish` endpoint
  - Implementing `dev` endpoint for quick development
  - Implementing `tail` endpoint to get logs
  - Tracking usage while running and implementing `usage` endpoint
- Implementing a set of CLI commands in the `reflect` package to invoke the service:
  - `init` to create a new app on the server
  - `publish` that builds the app and sends to server
  - `tail` that streams the logs to console
  - `dev`

Right now many of the fields of `createReflectServer` is a callback that takes an `Env` parameter. This is required so that, ie, `getLogLevel` can depend on the env.

However, (a) this is just annoying to type for every field, and (b) we've gotten user reports that other methods also want access to the env:

<img width=""909"" alt=""Screen Shot 2023-03-01 at 9 50 04 AM"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80388/222250307-d72ac052-ada8-4f16-8ac7-3759302c7480.png"">

I think CF did a bad thing with their env api design. It should be globally available to all user code somehow. So something like:

```ts
export function createReflectServer({env}: {env: Env}) {
  return {
    mutators,
    authHandler,
    logLevel,
    logSink,
    ...
  }
};
```

This will be a bit tricky to marry to CF's API because we don't find out about the env until `fetch()` in the case of the worker. But we can delay calling this function until then.

Another thing to check into is whether in CF, the env can change without restarting the context. I bet that it cannot. But if it can then we need to make the env field in the constructor a getter so it can return latest value (or maybe a function to make it clear it's dynamic)."

@jesseditson and I discovered this in the process of debugging rocicorp/mono#166. `DurableStorage#put` was throwing and this bubbled up to the `setInterval` call here: https://github.com/rocicorp/reflect-server/blob/c342e4eba5edba55b45eac5966052b464de44cfa/src/server/room-do.ts#L385.

I verified that if I just change that setInterval to `return Promise.reject(""bonk"")` , that error *also* doesn't show up in the `dev-worker` console.

This all was happening on `reflect-server@0.21.1` which uses an old wrangler. It is possible that the newest wrangler fixes this bug, that needs to be verified.

At some point we will want better large value support. I think this will also be useful, e.g., for yjs support.

I'm very tempted to implement this by using a rolling hash, ala prolly tree. I don't think we need the entire tree just the leaf nodes. We can encode a large value as an array of content-sliced chunks, then write the chunks as keys in replicache. Sync takes care of the rest?"

* reflect-server exports an implementation of DatadogLogSink, but reflect does not -- application must provide. This inconsistency is odd, but also:

* reflect exposes an abstract Metrics interface apps can implement, and we have an impl in datadog-util. But this impl doesn't stand alone, because it needs to talk to an endpoint that has the api key. This means that it is not really possible for the datadog impl of metrics to really be pluggable (at least not without a supporting server).

We should:

* Pull our custom DataDogLogSink into `datadog-util` so it can be used on both client and server.
* Add an option on both `Reflect` constructor and `createReflectServer()` like: `{datadog: {apiKey: string, enableLogs: true, enableMetrics: true}}`. Use this option to default the log sink.
* Change `logSinks` (plural) back to `logSink` (singular) and change the semantics: if `logSink` is present it overrides everything else and is the sole sink. Otherwise, the log sinks are `consoleLogSink` and `DatadogLogSink` (if `datadog` option provided).

60fps write cost kills us. We have a solution to this that we have spec'd but it's a lot of work.

# Proposal

Flush only every 5 seconds. There is a chance that if a DO crashes, a client can end up ahead of the server. In that case, we must detect the situation and delete optimistic data.

We can detect this situation by changing the notion of `version` that we store in the DO state. Right now we just store a single `version` field. The problem with that is that when a DO crashes and restarts, it might reuse versions that have already been vended (but not stored).

A simple solution is to store one version per running instance of the DO. We would then communicate to the client on connection which instance it is talking to. The client would save this information in the snapshot along with the version.

On reconnect, the client sends the instance it was last talking to _and_ the version. The server can then compare to the last known version from that instance and determine if the client is ahead. If it is, it closes connection with a special error code that causes the client to nuke its optimistic state.

# Warning

There is a minuscule case that the client goes offline at exactly the moment a DO crash occurs *and* the user works offline for a significant period of time. In this situation all the user's offline work would be lost.

I am fine with this situation for beta, but for GA we should decide to either abandon strict causal consistency in this situation or else do the fancy solution."

It is possible that the client and server might be on different versions.

If there are non backwards compatible changes then the client cannot communicate with the server.

### Proposed Solution

- The client sends its protocol version when it tries to connect. 
- If the server is not able to support that version it closes the connection with a `ProtocolMismatch` error kind.
- When the client sees a `ProtocolMismatch` it calls a callback with an error object that can be used to detect this case.
  - Default error handler is to reload?

### Open Question

- Does this overlap with `ReplicacheFormatVersion`?
  - It does not because the Replicache format version is only used to determine how the persistent storage is structured in IDB/memory
- How does this overlap with `PullVersion` and `PushVersion` used in Replicache?
  - A change in either of these would lead to a change in the `ProtocolVersion` change because `PullVersion` and `PushVersion` are used in `Poke` and `Push`
    - Actually `PushVersion` is used when we do a `PushRequest` in Replicache. It is not used in Reflect which seems to be a potential issue.
- How does this overlap with `SchemaVersion`?
  - This should not impact the `ProtocolVersion`...
    - I think we need to consider how `SchemaVersion` can be dealt with in the server side mutations

Fritz's notes here:

Background:
- seemed like a good idea to use datadog for metrics because we use it for logging. i think that's still right.
- datadog's metrics model assumes that metrics are collected/aggregated by something like [statsd](https://github.com/statsd/statsd) (their specific version is dogstatsd), which submits aggregates to datadog itself. statsd can run on node but it seemed like biting off more than we wanted to chew to just get metrics up and running to try to get statsd running on CF in a DO so i did not go that route, or at least deferred it until the client and dashboard pieces were up and running. i also didn't want to call into existence a separate process running it somewhere else like heroku. so for expedience decided to just submit metrics directly to datadog.
- submitting via the http api comes with constraints:
  - see https://docs.datadoghq.com/developers/dogstatsd/data_aggregation/#why-aggregate-metrics and https://docs.datadoghq.com/metrics/types/?tab=count#submission-types-and-datadog-in-app-types but basically we are constrained to using just count, rate, or distribution points when submitting via http api. and distribution points are the thing that is easiest to aggregate on the CF end, so that's what we use under the hood for our metrics: distribution points. 
  - the http api does not support cors because as mentioned datadog assumes something else is doing the aggregation and datadog does not want to receive a zillion dataponits individually from browsers or anywhere for that matter. so since we cannot submit points directly from the client to datadog we proxy them through a [worker endpoint](https://github.com/rocicorp/reflect-server/blob/04cc5ebcd2e239303a00fdc2a614201775e9bf50/src/server/worker.ts#L251). it literally just takes the body and sends it to datadog. 
  - in particular the proxy endpoint does not aggregate metrics. every submission from a client is sent directly to datadog. **this doesn't scale** so can't be used as is for customers with lots of clients. but is good enough for monday. this issue https://github.com/rocicorp/reflect-server/issues/293 captures the fact that it doesn't scale. what needs to happen is that the endpoint, possibly a DO though not necessarily, should buffer changes from clients and report them periodically to datadog instead of one at a time. doing this would also enable us to have a richer set of metrics on the client eg a Set of clientids in a particular state that gets buffered and translated into a count distribution point at datadog submission time. in doing this we'd need to be cognizant of the client reporting interval and the dashboard rollup window which must match in order for the dashboards to be accurate/sensible (more on this below).
  - our metrics proxy endpoint is not rate limited or authenticated
  - the capability is there but we do not currently pass tags like the app that is submitting the metrics or the environment (prod vs dev) so metrics from all sources are currently aggregated together in the dashboard
  - replidraw-do has metrics hooked up
- there is a script for spamming datadog with metrics so you can see the dashboards work: https://github.com/rocicorp/datadog-util/blob/main/tool/report-metrics.ts. otherwise there is too little traffic to see much of anything meaningful. 
- https://www.notion.so/replicache/metrics-0b848461ffce4312bdb645d65adb7da2 sketches the metrics that we started implementing. we have the time to connect (including never) and the reason the last connect failed metrics in place. 

OK so briefly how do they work? The thing we want is a count of clients that have a particular state in a moment of time, or over a period of time. For example, we want to say across all clients how long have they taken to connect, or how many are (un)connected at this moment, or how many clients are logged out because of auth. Notice that these most important questions ask for a count of *clients* that have a property at a given instant or over a period of time. They do not ask for a count of *events* like 'a client got logged out for auth' or 'a connect attempt took 2s'. If we counted events like this then the counts would be skewed by clients that are reconnect looping or similar. We want to know how many *clients* in the *population* have a property. 

The way we do this is by sampling in the client and aggregating in the dashboard. We have a reporting period in the client that is currently 2m. Once every 2m each client submits exactly one datapoint per metric. So if we look at a 2m span we will see very close to if not exactly one data point per client. We can count the number of clients with a given property over that span and it also gives us the total number of clients reporting which is just how many data points we see for a given metric in that span. In the dashboard we do a count rollup over 2m to get these numbers. If the client is reporting at a different interval, or the dashboard is not rolling up over a span that matches the reporting interval, the numbers are not going to make sense. 

Also I guess note that metrics are good for counting things in a snapshot of time, or instantaneously. They are not good for stateful computations like what's the history of this client. We'd need to keep the data in a form separately queryable to answer those questions. 

In order to create a dashboard:
1. you have to enable 'advanced percentages' for the distribution metric in question in data dog. It's under Metrics > Summary, search for the metric and enable advanced percentiles which enable threshold queries.
2. stack graphs are typically what we want. configure a dashboard with timeseries type and then add the metrics in question eg `count(v: v<=600000):time_to_connect_ms{*}.as_count().rollup(120)` is the count of clients with time to connect <= 600s over a 120s window. the little bar slider icon on the right of the metric field in the edit view will enable you to edit the formula directly wihtout having to use the pulldowns and whatnot. 
3. create the stack. list the metrics in the order that you want them (a first, b second, etc). sometimes you want to do math on metrics like to subtract the count of clients connecting in 20s from 10s so you can stack just those in the range 10s-20s on top of the count of those connecting in <=10s. to do this you can toggle display of the metric in question of by clicking its letter eg 'a'. we need the metric but we don't want it displayed. instead, add a formula to the bottom with the right order. eg you can say something like:
  ```
  (not selected for display)  a: count(v: v<=20000):time_to_connect_ms{*}.as_count().rollup(120)
  (not selected for display)  b: count(v: v<=10000):time_to_connect_ms{*}.as_count().rollup(120)
  ...
  (selected for display):       formula: a-b
  (selected for display):       formula: b
  ```
  This will show the count of clients connecting in 10s with count of connecting between 10s and 20s on top of it. Note that datadog will sometimes ""clean up"" the formula and re-name the metric labels which is annoying but it usually does it in a way that doesn't mess the graph up. It must have some kind of canonical form for storage that they get put into.
  
  4. Add tags to the metrics contructor eg `['env:prod', 'service:reflectserver']` and they you can use them in the space aggregator in the metric formula eg `count(v: v<=20000):time_to_connect_ms{env:prod,service:reflectserver}.as_count().rollup(120)`

You can see how metrics are integrated here: https://github.com/rocicorp/replidraw-do/blob/d3d3f1711b2475e614f13640bfd2a498599bd74c/src/pages/d/%5Bid%5D.tsx#L30-L36 and then you simply pass the metrics to the reflect constructor: https://github.com/rocicorp/replidraw-do/blob/d3d3f1711b2475e614f13640bfd2a498599bd74c/src/pages/d/%5Bid%5D.tsx#L49. When you want metrics in reflect server itself we'd just do the same thing.

Dashboard for our two metrics are found here: https://app.datadoghq.com/dashboard/vm5-ce6-p67/reflect-client-metrics. On the left are the ""real"" dashboards that roll up over 2m (120s). On the right are the same but with 10s rollupts for use with the report-metrics metric-spamming script above.

For a customer to use these dashboards they need to:
- instantiate and pass metrics like replidraw-do does, ideally using tags for their service and environment
- once they start receiving metrics they need to configure advanced percentiles for our metrics: time_to_connect_ms, last_connect_error_{auth_invalidated, client_not_found, invalid_connection_request, invalid_message, ping_timeout, room_closed, room_not_found, unauthorized, unexpected_base_cookie, unexpected_last_mutation_id}. 
- import our dashboard. we can export it to json from the dashboard view and they can import the json.

@arv note that if you add a timeout as a connect error reason to cover connect() actually timing out, you'll need:
1. add it to the report-metrics script and run it so we start getting the metric
2. configure advanced percentiles for the metric in datadog
3. add the metric to the last connect error dashboards, but the real one and the test/report-metrics one.

for some reason my browser screenshotting is not working so here's a full screen shot of the two graphs (report-metrics spammed versions).

In Replicache we already set the precedence for how to do this. Here is how it works in **Replicache**:

- The API has a way to provide a function called `getAuth` with the type `() => MaybePromise<string | null | undefined>`.
- Whenever the server returns a `401` we call the `getAuth` function. The function can do HTTP requests, put up dialogs, etc.
- If the function returns a string. `replicachecInstance.auth` is assigned this new auth value and...
- Replicache retries the previously failed push/pull with the new auth.
- This retrying happens `MAX_REAUTH_TRIES` times.

## Reflect Client

In reflect we will do pretty much the same.
- reflect-server will send a close with an error kind
- When we get a `ErrorKind.AuthInvalidated` or `ErrorKind.Unauthorized` we enter into a state where _needsReauth_ is `true`
  - When _neesReauth_ is `true` we will ""call"" the `options.authToken` getter again. This can be a string or a function that returns a string. It can be async as well.

The API is:

```ts
authToken: MabePromise<string> | (() => MaybePromise<string>);
```"

xut4J7fPqhioTXsCGnVc8,Improve Datadog Logger,false,1684892165000.0,1673617527000.0,arv,"Datadog has a concept of [attributes](https://docs.datadoghq.com/logs/log_configuration/attributes_naming_convention/#default-standard-attribute-list), These are exposed in the UI in a special way.

The DD browser API allows you to pass these attributes using the `messageContext` parameter.

```ts
log(message, messageContext, status)
```

For the DD HTTP REST API the `messageContext` is the json object sent as the payload.

If `messageContext` is set to `{network: {client: {ip: '1.2.3.4'}}}` then the Client IP shows up in their UI as shown in this screenshot.

<img width=""763"" alt=""dd-ip"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45845/212326598-707db242-b2fe-47f0-948d-60b5d259e960.png"">

`LogContext` has a different concept of _context_. Its context is added to the `message`.

Instead of the current way, I'm proposing we change `LogContext` `addContext` to add to a context object and pass this to DataDog as a `messageContext`. For example:

```ts
const lc = new LogContext();
lc.info('a');
// sends
// {message: 'a', status: 'info'}
const lc2 = lc.addContext('b', 'c');
lc2.info('d'); 
// {message: 'd', status: 'info', b: 'c'}
```

DD also allows the attribute to contain `.` and then it builds the object structure as needed. For example, the following two context objects are equivalent:

```js
const a = {'network.client.ip': '1.2.3.4'};
const b = {network: {client: {ip': '1.2.3.4'}}};

- [x] rocicorp/mono#181
- [x] rocicorp/mono#180
  - related to https://github.com/rocicorp/reflect-server/issues/230 for DO duration reasons we should probably disconnect on ""hide"" and reconnect on ""show"" (but stop short of disconnecting users from idle rooms, which requires more thought/discussion)
- [ ] consider having a canary http request that is issued when connect fails to determine if the user is offline and include that bit in the logs/metrics
- [x] rocicorp/mono#179
- [ ] take a look at the out of order poke problem which we do not have an explanation for. is there anything we can add or track that could help shed light on it? https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/issues/233
- ensure the logs include the following information:
  - [ ] when a connection is closed log the time the connection was open and how many messages were received
  - [x] connection closed log line should include the reason the connection closed (auth failure, blur, connect timeout, ping/pong failure, etc)
  - [ ] when it successfully connects, include the length of time it took to connect in the log line
- [ ] I think we want metrics that tell us connection-related information. This requires metrics to be added (https://github.com/rocicorp/reflect-server/issues/254) but also some design to figure out how to express what we are interested in. A proposal will follow. Kind of intuitively we want:
  - from the client:
    - information about whether a client is connecting or having trouble connecting. If the client is online and it can't connect we want to know how often it is happening and why (connect timeout, auth failure, connection quickly reset for some reason). 
    - [ ] how long it takes to connect
    - [ ] how frequently it is getting disconnect for an unexpected reason (server abruptly disconnects, ping/pong failure, etc), exclusive of blur and clean shutdown, and also connections that are closed without receiving a message
    - [ ] connection uptime 
- [ ] in the above, we need to factor in that bc of dd31 going offline for long periods of time is expected 
- Something something ondisconnect? 

I think this issue does NOT necessarily include adding an http fallback. I think this is getting our current connection logic into a place we want. We can evaluate from here whether it is worth prioritizing a fallback."

Probably a common cause of this is tabs being in the background and forgotten about. We could disconnect the socket on the tab hide event and reconnect on show.

It's also worth implementing an ""idle"" feature: if a client doesn't send any mutations for awhile, or receive any pokes, it disconnects itself. A potential problem with this is that if the tab is in the foreground, and this idle disconnect happens, then a collaborator could join and start doing things and user would not notice."

In terms of absolute numbers, - 54 unique (and logged-in)  users that failed to connect is a lot for 3 days 
I'm also getting tickets from users who say Canvas does not load for them - and looking at the logs it seems like they can't connect
looking at the increase in the number of these tickets and from generally looking at our metrics it seems something is off - is it possible that one of the last versions we deployed had a change that could cause it?
Anyway, I understand you want to wait to get more info before adding http fallback, but for me this is something we need to fix asap. Since we are time sensitive, I feel comfortable saying we need to add the fallback (or other solution you may find more suitable)
This is the room id of the last user that said he can't connect - 0qXSAxeauYhR6owats8Dx0fekcv3VLmZ. 
I think that looking at data dog we miss some key data points. In DD you are looking at who connected eventually . In the screenshot below we are looking at a 10 seconds time window. It shows us the number of clients who moved from offline to online within 10 seconds or less. We can see that ~10% didn't connect within 10 seconds or less 

<img width=""1474"" alt=""2"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80388/209034023-24d2ea39-1c98-4452-8fa9-bfac5edb0d7c.png"">

Here we are looking at 60, 120 and 360 seconds time windows 

<img width=""1470"" alt=""3"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80388/209034056-6708c45c-4a1d-45b6-8057-d43db583d11a.png"">

Neither room ever shows up in server logs. And we log the URL of the connection request extremely early in startup, so it is near impossible that if our code starts the room ID would not show up servers-side.

I am still suspicious that this isn't just proxies and other networking hijinks though. I do see something else happening on the server around that same time, but I can't be sure it's from same client:

It's the ""account"" room starting up. Unfortunately, I don't have the client-side logs for the account room so I can't know if this is from the same device/user.

If it is from same user it would be interesting because it would mean some messages from that user *are* getting to server after all and something else is going on.

# Summary

So summarizing, for this particular user, all we can say with confidence is that they tried to connect but never did successfully.

There's a possibility that they did actually talk to the server and then something else went wrong.

# Actions for this user:

* @noamackerman: Do you have the account ID of the user who reported the bug? Is it `14530460`? If it is the user that would be intersting.

# Actions to help debug things like this in the future:

Monday:

1. Can you please setup client-side datadog logging for the account room too?
2. It appears that you are setting the same disconnect handler for the account room as you are the canvas room, which is causing noise:

<img width=""636"" alt=""Screen Shot 2022-12-21 at 1 29 06 PM"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80388/209022707-53dddd8e-54b2-4ffb-892a-828a03c0cbd9.png"">

Note that the roomID is `account/`. If you do mean to run a disconnect handler here, you should guard against this state not existing yet when disconnect happens because it is possible for disconnect to happen before any message is processed and the state hasn't been created.

Rocicorp:

* We need to add the client IP to the server-side log context so we can for sure know if a specific device *ever* talks to our server: https://github.com/rocicorp/reflect-server/issues/229

What many people ask about and feels natural to them is an interface that feels more similar to the `Reflect` interface from the client, where they can use `watch()` and `suscribe()` via the API they already know.

This needs some thought because I don't think we want people actually programmatically invoking mutators via the server, but perhaps we could subset the interface somehow.

Other common requests in this area:

- Is there some way an external process can invoke some change on a room?
- onDisconnect (if we do allow users to directly call mutators, then the onDisconnect API could be the same on client and server)
- Is there some way to do some work async (ie call some other system) then mutate after?"

For persist, since we set up all the data to be persisted in the benchmark with mutations, in the new algorithm this is done by rebasing the mutations onto the perdag (as opposed to gathering chunks and persisting chunks in the old algorithm).  this is necessary for correctness.  Its more realistic that the bulk of the data to persist would come from a snapshot commit, with smaller amounts of data coming from local mutations.  We should update the benchmark to reflect the different perf of persisting snapshots vs mutations.

1. Some customers don't need it and it makes things more complicated for them. Examples:
 * Vercel doesn't currently use persistence, but the presence of persistent data means they need code to delete idbs on logout for privacy reasons (#432).
 * Placemark eventually wants to use persistence to support larger drawings but for right now, they are blocked on that for performance reasons. So persistence just creates problems for them (ie rocicorp/mono#46)
3. IDB doesn't work in Firefox incognito (#433), so we need a memory path eventually at least for that reason.

With Reflect the core of the featureset might very well move to multiplayer with persistence a valuable and optional addition rather than something that should be default-on. From the perspective of somebody who bought Replicache for multiplayer being able to just `persistence: true` seems absurdly magical."

1. Vercel runs Replicache in the context of some host app. Their IDB data is intermixed with any Replicache data from host. They want an easy way to find and delete just their IDB instances (e.g., on logout). Right now they can do that by parsing our registry idb but it relies on private Replicache knowledge and is awkward.

So we should do *something*. Right now, Placemark says that when you do this, there is a ""hash mismatch"" error. Perhaps this is rocicorp/mono#47?

Big picture it seems like we need to define what should happen when you rollback. I don't think it's practical to say that we support mutation recovery. I think our options are:

1. don't try to recover newer formats (ignore them)
2. delete newer formats (assumption: we are rolling back because something bad happened and there's a chance we can't read that data anyway)

msfBFWwz1BHa9a4P0wpxj,JSONValue Optional Properties?,false,1677091398000.0,1668422175000.0,arv,"rocicorp/replicache-internal#364 

## Background:

- JSON does not allow undefined.
- IDB allows undefined
- We have historically allowed our JSON objects to have properties with an undefined value by using TS optional properties.
- We have filtered out undefined properties in some code paths
  - before writing to a store
  - but not when manually calling mutators

## Goals

- No cloning or freezing in release mode

### Nice to haves

- Get static (compile time) errors when passing in an undefined property.
- Runtime errors in debug mode when passing in an undefined property.
- No difference in behavior between debug and release mode.


## Alternative A

- Allow optional property values in JSON objects but do no filtering
- When pull happens these properties will be missing so reading them will get undefined again
- Footgun with object spread operator because it might replace existing properties with undefined values:

```ts
type Data = {
  id: string,
  name: string,
  description?: string,
};

type UpdateData = {
  id: string,
  name?: string,
  description?: string,
};


async function update(tx, updateData: UpdateData) {
  const oldData: Data | undefined = await tx.get(updateData.id);
  assert(oldData);
  const newData: Data = { ...oldData, ...updateData };
  await tx.put(newData);
}
```

If `updateData` has a property with value of undefined the above will override the existing property.



## Alternative B

- Do not allow optional properties in JSON objects
- One problem is that TypeScript is not very strict about this and fails to flag  incorrect usage. We can enable `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` and we can ask our customers to do the same. But, it is a pretty invasive change. Without `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` you can pass an object with and explicit `undefined` value into replicache and [TS will not complain](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play?useUnknownInCatchVariables=true&exactOptionalPropertyTypes=false&ts=4.8.4#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-x27G9FoYVqBCuZrOhsPhiJV6P5EFxYmFy288GDFKpNLpcrYivBkOznLzDsLxYJRNF5eqlbgUprsoZ9eZ9tVGKd0Z17vjXoYZpTVptdtbqMdGu1bv1s+TvuXAcoQA).
- Detect this in debug mode and throw an error.
  - It is very likely that customers will only test replicache in release mode.

Right now the only strategy is to either add manual `console.log` calls to the code, which doesn't benefit from the log messages, or to find the assertion that failed and add something like `testLogSink.messages.map((m) => console.error(m))`, which often requires refactoring the surrounding code to ensure the log sink is actually available. 

We should have a mechanism that makes it easy to output log messages from a test that fails. I'm happy if they spew for all failing tests. But even better if we can do it selectively. Adding a line of code would be fine.

Some questions:

1. What does this stack correspond to? Can we use the trick that @arv just did in Replicache to demangle the stack and see where this is coming from?
2. Why isn't it persistent? From looking at stack I'm guessing this is happening when *reading* data from Replicache. Only way I would expect it to be not persistent is if:
  a. The value getting read was out of a pending transaction
  b. The value getting read isn't read in every run of the app
3. Why isn't the error better: it looks like what's happening here are there are some undefined values in the JSON. The error should say what field exactly was undefined if that's the issue."

w-m-1MtivCOqjAD1DEVPY,make FPS safe and correct,false,1681147166000.0,1663741115000.0,phritz,"## Background
- we are not doing [streaming reflect](https://www.notion.so/replicache/WIP-Streaming-Replicache-4acd7513121949f5898f7eeeeeaef96f) in the near term
- however reflect as currently built assumes the output gate is disabled, as it would be for streaming reflect
- unfortunately, without a complete streaming implementation, replicache is not correct unless the output gate is enabled
- monday has enabled the output gate, and [output gate enabled will become the default](https://github.com/rocicorp/reflect-server/issues/154)
- we therefore have a reflect that operates under the assumption that the output gate is disabled, which not longer holds. we need to make the adjustments that enable MP to work well when the output gate is enabled
- the primary effect of enabling the output gate is that a write to transactional storage takes ~30ms and prevents outgoing messages from being sent until it is complete
- @ingar has demonstrated that ws message sending throughput from DO to client is not materially affected by this additional latency. latency obviously increases, but throughput doesn't change much. 
- i have demonstrated to myself that the maximum send rate of out outbound 4kb ws messages from a DO to ~50 clients is in the neighborhood of 8000/second. and that's if the DO does nothing but send messages. It would be prudent to limit ourselves to say ~2000 outgoing msgs/sec.

## Current model
The idea in the current reflect server code is to send a poke to each client on every frame. Sixty times per second (so every ~16ms) the server creates a frame update. It applies all the mutations it has to in-memory data structures, computes the pokes, writes the data structures to transactional storage (with output gate disabled), and sends pokes to all connected clients. Mutations arriving during and between runs are queued for processing in the next run, and all available mutations are consumed during a run. The client replays pokes in order as soon as it receives them.

Aside from the not-correctness of revealing mutations before they have been confirmed, here are some other things that can happen that might not be desirable (or maybe we don't care, dunno):
- reflect server doesn't use information about the temporal spacing of mutations in the originating client. Two mutations that happened frames apart but are delivered to the reflect server at the same time get lumped into the same frame. (Similarly, two mutations that happened in the same frame could appear in different frames if delivery of the second is delayed). Not saying this is a problem we need to fix, just saying this is going to happen.
- similar thing on the receiving client end: it just plays pokes as they are received. Pokes that were sent representing separate frames that arrive close together get replayed in the same frame, and if the second of two consecutive frames' pokes is delayed then there is a gap in client replay. 

When we enable the output gate we guarantee that we'll end up making this kind of thing worse: we'll group changes that span several frames into the same frame maybe on the server and receiving client, reducing apparent FPS on the receiving client. 

The fundamental problem is trying to do 30ms of work (flushing writes) in 16ms. If there's a mechanism that causes the loop to iterate only every 30ms, eg backpressure or waiting for the last write to flush, then two frames of incoming mutations pile up while the write completes and end up grouped together in the next frame. If there's no such mechanism then the loop just gets farther and farther behind (it continues to pile up 30ms writes followed by msg sends every 16ms, meaning clients get further and further behind). And either way, pokes only flow out every 30-45ms, depending on how it works, meaning tons of skipped frames. 

## What to do
It seems clear that we need to resurrect something like the old [game loop idea](https://www.notion.so/replicache/Replicache-Game-Loop-37d8d320ea6540ef8c1907dee26e232b) but simpler, where every N > 30 ms we process several frames of mutations into a sequence of updates to be played back sequentially. Aaron has said that if the loop turns every 500ms that would be a bummer bc of the latency hit but still probably ok. Luckily it seems like we could do much better. If the loop turns every ~4 frames (=4*16ms=64ms) it seems like the ~30ms write should have plenty of time to complete. 

Some additional thoughts:
- i don't see any reason to queue up mutations and process them in a batch, it seems like we could process mutations as they arrive
- for efficiency's sake (writes to storage including cache are expensive) we probably want to process mutations in memory and flush to storage at the end of every turn. This however potentially limits size of the data we can work with bc DOs are limited to 128MB including the cache (which I guess we can disable). 
- we do not have an explicit signal that writes have flushed. without one, I'm not sure how we could tell whether the server is getting behind. YOLO?
- i don't think we should try to re-use the current loop implementation except for the in-memory datastore part. there's a lot of complexity that seems unnecessary at this point
- there needs to be some mechanism for the receiving client to jump forward and apply mutations in batch if it has a bunch of frames but not enough time to replay them. 
- we have in the past been enamored of the idea that we could use mutation timestamps from the sending client to have perfect replay. the mechanism by which the sending client, server, and receiving client clocks are aligned is not clear and seems complicated, my guess is we could start with maybe server receive timestamp (or better, frame number) and see if it works
- let's start low tech 
- we should have a way to tinker with the settings and see what it looks like under various assumptions. @arv i think had an amazing simulator for replidraw IIRC that automated a ton of clients all moving stuff around at the same time, something like that would be killer.
- note rocicorp/reflect-server#154 should probably come first? "

Distilling it down:
- for each end user account the customer has, the customer keeps the list of rooms that user owns
- when an end user deletes their account with the customer they can request that their data be deleted too. 'their data' means:
   - all rooms owned by that user and whatever is in them
   - all metadata about the user's rooms
   - (unclear -- confirming this) room data on any client that is or attempts to connect to the room (?)
   - any of this user's data in _other_ rooms has PII removed. **This would not be an easy thing for us to do** and it seems complicated to provide the interfaces that would enable the customer to tell us how to do it. Luckily monday already stores anonymized data in CF so this is a nop for us. Seems like customers that are real businesses are all going to need a solution here, so maybe we should be telling them to store anonymized data in CF? @aboodman ?

It logs everyone out of the room (authInvalidateForRoom) and then calls into an interface on the roomdo that deletes all its data (`storage.deleteAll` -- read the docs for deleteAll, it might need to be called repeatedly until it succeeds). Once the roomdo has deleted all the data then the authdo should probably remove all the connection records for the room from its storage so `authRevalidateConnections` doesn't go re-create the object. 
   - @grgbkr is there any other metadata aside from the list of connections that needs to be cleaned up? any cache? other list of rooms? etc
- decide whether a room can be re-created. my sense is 'no' but it's not a strong feeling -- to me a room name is a unique identifier and we are asking for problems re-using them.
   - if 'no' then we need to decide the mechanism by which a deleted room is prevented from being recreated, as well as say what should happen when a client tries to connect to a deleted room. this last part is related to the question of whether we need to delete room data from all clients.
   - if 'yes' then we need to say how we distinguish between a client who has data from the old instance of the room and one who has data from the new room. maybe the cookie just works for this, dunno. also the customer has to be completely sure they have scrubbed all metadata for the room (eg, perms) bc they definitely do not want old metadata to apply to a new room.
- let monday know when the api is available so they can start using it. they need to be sure that they clean up all metadata for the room on their end.

Another option is to have 2 instances of Replicache. One on the main thread and one on the web worker. That has the problem that both of the instances have to `pull` to be synchronized. With DD31 the need to pull to sync goes away.

But even with DD31, one needs to provide the same mutators and indexes to get the instance to share the sync branch. It also needs to periodically refresh. 

Another option might be to provide a readonly view/mirror on top of an existing Replicache IDB. This would periodically run refresh or get triggered to refresh from other clients on the same sync branch."

Next.js is not doing that much for us and adds mental overhead to the quickstart. Let's get rid of it.

Let's factor a `replicache-node` out of `replicache-nextjs`. I think we should go for pure node. No express, no nothing. I think this package would be server-only, no client (no client bits needed, because without Next.js the complexity of instantiating Replicache client goes away).

This will become the main quickstart. 

`replicache-nextjs` will remain as a thin wrapper around it `replicache-node` -- the main purpose is to support the nextjs integration and partnership.

### Infrastructure

The code will live on the `main` branch.

We will introduce a global flag called DD31 which will be `false` by default.

There are some public APIs that will need changes. During the transition period we will duplicate them and name them with DD31 in their names. We will however not export these from `src/mod.ts` so they will not show up in the npm package.

For testing we can run the tests twice, once with DD31 true and once with false.

- [x] Have esbuild strip this code
- [x] Setup the test runner to run twice.
- [ ] ~Run perf tests on both?~ 

### perdag

TBD

Verify that we have these three heads and no other heads

- [x] `mainBranches`
- [x] `clients`

### memdag

memdag has one new head:
- [x] `refresh`

### Clients

- [x] Add `tempRefreshHash?: Hash;`, including correctly managing refs on the ClientMap chunk for these hashes
- [x] Add `mainBranchID: BranchID;`
- [x] simplify updateClients once we go back to synchronous hashing (or uuids), today it uses a test and set approach to avoid async hashing in idb transaction

### Branches
- [x] Create Branch helpers analogous to Client helpers.   getBranch, getBranches, setBranch, setBranches.  
- [x] Ensure that the chunk that contains the BranchMap has refs to each Branchs'  headHash.

### Commits

- [x] Add `clientID` to `LocalMeta`
- [x] Change `SnapshotMeta` to use a map of last mutation IDS: `+ readonly lastMutationIDs: Map<ClientID, number>;`
- [ ] rocicorp/mono#64
- [x] Implement `getLastMutationIDForClient(clientID)` that walks the commit chain as needed. (64bfc27dbabedff31a6b8e977360850b5d720088) end up just calling this getMutationID(clientID)
- [x] Implement getNextMutationID on top of getLastMutationIDForClient(clientID) (64bfc27dbabedff31a6b8e977360850b5d720088)
- [x] rocicorp/mono#39


### Startup

- [x] Bootstrap from `main` branch with identical mutator names and indexes if one exist.
- [x] Otherwise, if there are existing `main` branches,  chose `main` branch with newest cookie and fork from it's base snapshot (fixing up indexes as necessary and clearing last mutation ids).     
- [x] If no main branches exist, simply create a new `main` branch with an empty base snapshot.

### Persist

- [x] Implement `gatherLocalCommitsGreaterThan` (4c5dec18a2c5c36b01561f00dfafa01a5a19dcb1)
- [x] Implement `getLastMutationIDForClient(clientID)` that walks the commit chain as needed. (64bfc27dbabedff31a6b8e977360850b5d720088)
- [x] Implement/refactor `rebase`. Our code is not structured like that at the moment. We have `Replicache.p._maybeEndPull` and `sync maybeEndPull` which deals with this logic. (65557c14fc4ada6b2c3f2209b050998f601c36be)
- [x] Implement persist algorithm https://www.notion.so/replicache/DD-3-1-e42489fc2e6b4340a01c7fa0de353a30#92b4b58d07d14e9296ba8b975e312130 (ecbe9f1b8ff0f13c78a28578acb4e81ee8652ff6)

### Hashing and temp hashes
- [x] replace perdag async hashing with sync hashing (either wasm or uuid)
- [x] possibly replace memdag temp hashing with uuids, in which case need to add a new way to identify memdag only chunks for copying to perdag as part of persist

### Refresh

- [x] Implement [algorithm](https://www.notion.so/replicache/DD-3-1-e42489fc2e6b4340a01c7fa0de353a30#ecdb40894ff442c2ba7623600b63e3f1)
- [x] Figure out interval to run on, probably want to run after running persist to increase chance of base snapshot in perdag main branch >= then memdag main branch (59ab943174bdd9a94e58faba8a3c85a4e1cf4be7)

### Push

Updates the protocol slightly

- [x] rocicorp/mono#144
- [x] rocicorp/mono#145

### Pull

Pull now has to handle rebasing interleave mutations from multiple clients.
- [x] `gatherPendingMutations`
- [x] `getBaseSnapshot`

p2DS_Ww4_P7n5OlZlTPY3,When server-side data is deleted things go wrong fast,true,1689319383000.0,1655690311000.0,aboodman,"# Problem

We already have a special [ClientStateNotFound](https://github.com/rocicorp/replicache-internal/blob/main/src/puller.ts#L31) error when the server-side database exists but the requesting client's state has been deleted. This causes Replicache to refresh, assigning a new client.

But what happens if the entire *database* is deleted? This comes up a lot during development, when e.g., a dev might delete entire server database storage.

We don't have any concept of a ""database"" in the protocol directly, but in practice applications typically do. For example, all our sample apps use the concept of a *space* which is in the ID. 

What happens when a space gets deleted on the server side? This is not well defined by our protocol, and it practice,  e.g., in replicache-todo, it's complex:

* For any pulls that happen before the space is re-created, it's basically a no-op (the lmid defaults to zero and server returns empty patch)
* The next push from any client recreates the space with cookie:0
* All existing clients still have their old data, but don't get updates initially because they are at cookie X but the server reset to cookie zero. They also can't send new data because their lmid reset to zero, but they are at lmid > 0.
* New clients from an existing cache fork from existing clients. This means that they inherit that old client's cookie! So they can't get updates either! (for awhile, see below)
* But, the new client is at lmid:0, so they start sending pushes which are accepted. These pushes are accepted by the server, but not acknowledged (local cache is at cookie: X>0, server is at 0, so the pull is empty). Thus the local mutations are rolled back. For awhile.
* After enough pushes, the server's cookie reaches X again and 'catches up' with the client. After this, pushes from this cache begin being accepted again and the situation resolves.

Note that `ClientStateNotFound` doesn't solve this issue. If the server returns that, it will cause existing clients to refresh, which just creates a new client forked from the old one.

# Proposal

Introduce a new `ServerNotFound` error which causes the client to delete the entire cache and reload. 

This can be done as a backward-compatible extension of the protocol, albeit a little ugly:

1. Define a `onServerNotFound` callback similar to the existing `onClientStateNotFound` callback. Default this to:
  * delete local cache (entire idb)
  * reload 
2. Extend the current pull response to also allow a new `ServerNotFoundResponse` with `{error: ""ServerNotFound""}`. Wire this to the new `onServerNotFound` callback.
3. Currently the response to the push endpoint is ignored. Add an optional `application/json` response. If the response is JSON, parse it. Allow both `ClientStateNotFound` and `ServerNotFound` errors for the push handler and wire them to the appropriate callbacks.

Today this dead-locks. We have an `RWLock` for the `BTreeWrite` and we create a read lock for `scan` and a write lock for `put`.

The optimal behavior is that the scan is live and new entries _after_ the current entry show up and deleted entries _after_ the current entry are skipped.

LR3JYhtUJQa1m9H8d_axg,Recovering from a completely missing database,false,1677091446000.0,1654815577000.0,aboodman,"Right now if you delete the backend database that Replicache is talking to completely, the client does something ... weird.

For example on the replicache-todo app, if the server is deleted while the client is running:

- push will correctly see the client as new and skip the mutations because they don't start at correct mutation ID
- pull will either return an empty patch (correctly) or if the server returns ClientNotFound then the client will reload

But the interesting part happens on reload. There's now a new client ID.

- push will start processing mutations. The new client is correctly starting at clientID zero. A new space will be allocated.
- pull will not succeed initially (return no patch) because request cookie is higher than server cookie. But once enough mutations get sent it will start working. This means that the client will be permanently out of sync with the server as it has state from before the server rebooted that never gets taken away.

I think we need to have an explicit error code that means ""the database you are trying to talk to doesn't exist anymore, give up all hope, delete everything"".

But probably also we should wait until the new offline-first stuff is designed as it might affect the way client IDs are allocated (or might not)."

But now it's even harder to install because (a) there is a bigger chance of screwing up the postgres install and (b) you need a pusher account.

We need to do something about this. We need it to be one step to get started.

I looked into knex and was really hopeful. I got it working for postgres. But knex is not really a SQL abstraction, so many things break between it and SQLite. Example: SQLite doesn't support boolean or date columns. It just seems really brittle.

Maybe the better thing is what @cesara suggested -- use pgmem. I discarded this in favor of knex because I was thinking it would be hard to test offline with an in-memory database (because can't kill it and restart it). But I forgot -- you could kill it by pausing the process with ctrl+z!.

So I'm thinking the right path is maybe pgmem + ... something ... for poke. Maybe the something is server-sent events? I'm a little worried about doing our own websocket thing because I want to keep the complexity down in this special path."

https://www.notion.so/replicache/half-idea-for-productionizing-watch-cf3110a59db446a59848ea40f48b799b

# Problem

`watch` was an interesting experiment (https://doc.replicache.dev/api/classes/Replicache#experimentalwatch) and has produced large value in several of our customers' projects, plus repliear. However, it also introduces undesirable complexity. Every app that uses it needs to implement the same pattern of applying the watch output to maintain a view. In repliear: https://github.com/rocicorp/repliear/blob/main/frontend/app.tsx#L313. In placemark: https://gist.github.com/tmcw/7d38380e0e2dee41ff6df18942742f65. Finally, `watch()` duplicates a subset of `scan()` but not all of it. It's non-DRY.

# Proposal

What if we extend `ScanResult` with a `watch()` method? This way we immediately solve the duplicate interface problem. `ScanResult.watch()` then returns a stream of diff operations matching the params immediately passed to scan.

We can eliminate the view-maintenance code in React apps by a `useScan()` helper to `replicache-react` which calls `watch()` and does the view-maintenance internally. The `useScan()` hook would re-fire whenever its contents change in some way, but the identity of the values within the array would stay unchanged to facilitate use with `memo()`.

It may also be useful to add a `collect()` helper to ScanResult which does this view maintenance if other frameworks want it (needs investigation).

# Search Helpers

The above proposal only helps when the UI is directly displaying a scan, not filtering it or manipulating it in any way. In Repliear, for example, this wouldn't completely solve our problem because of the complex filters.

However, by adding several more helper methods to `ScanResult` we can replace all the view management code in Repliear:

* `ScanResult::filter(f: ([k: string, v: ReadonlyJSONValue]) => boolean) => ScanResult`
* `ScanResult::sort(f: ([k1: string, v1: ReadonlyJSONValue], [k2: string, v2: ReadonlyJSONValue]) => number)`
* (maybe, not sure if there's a need) `ScanResult::map(f: (k: string, v: ReadonlyJSONValue) => ReadonlyJSONValue) => ScanResult`

These method can be chained together so that in total you can say things like:

```ts
const watch = rep.scan({prefix: ""foo"", limit: 40, startAt: ""fp""})
    .filter((k, v) => v.bar > v.baz)
    .sort(([v1],[v2]) => v1.size - v2.size)
    .map((,v) => v)
    .watch(diffOp => doSomething) // or toArray to just get results once!
```

The neat thing is that each of filter, sort, and map can be implemented incrementally so that the cost for updates after the first result is very low.

But the *really* cool thing is that you can then do in React:

```ts
const data = useWatch(scanResult)
```

... and the hook will re-fire whenever the data changes. The result will be an array, with only the values changed inside that changed. 

# Performance

A naive implementation of this would re-scan for each watch whenever the underlying data changes. But a better impl can re-use a single scan to update all watches.

# Impact

I believe that we could probably deprecate subscribe and replace it with this API. I am not familiar with anyone using subscribe for anything beyond what this API does, and this is much more efficient and easier way to do it. This would also enable frameworks like Solid which want to get access to the underlying values as they change so they can feed them into their own dependency tracking system."

It looks like this can only happen if a Chunk references itself but that should not happen.

Let's add some asserts in here as well as in when we create the meta array.

You can see the bundle size check [run successfully](https://github.com/rocicorp/replicache-internal/actions/runs/2205455219) and see the data point for the recent commit `1c6460f` [in the graph](https://rocicorp.github.io/replicache-internal/bundle-sizes/). 

However for the perf test the [run ran successfully and detected a ""regression""](https://github.com/rocicorp/replicache-internal/actions/runs/2205455218) and I got an email about it. But there was no data point for `1c6460f` appended to the [graph](https://rocicorp.github.io/replicache-internal/perf-v2/). The last data point is for `558d93c` which was a week ago. I thought this was a problem with replicache-internal's setup, but it looks like [replicache's perf graph has a similar problem](https://rocicorp.github.io/replicache/perf-v2/) -- the last commit there is `59e8869`. 

I doubt that it is coincidence that the next commit is https://github.com/rocicorp/replicache/commit/495d9b7f48e6ba67ff2cfdcecd7777477a23dcf1 which makes changes to the perf test. We don't see any more perf test data points after that commit. 

I wonder if something changed that now when a regression is detected a perf data point is not appended because the run appears to have ""failed""? Like maybe the exit code changed or something? "

Noam said the customer did 25m of work which was lost on refresh.

This room ID doesn't appear in the logs at all, and I don't see anything abnormal in the logs from that period.

I asked Noam to check whether this room has any data on the server-side, haven't heard back yet.

It's not reproducible from what I understand. Still, this is a pretty awful bug for a customer to experience -- silently losing a big chunk of customer data.

Ideas, prioritized:
- We should capture client-side logs and send to datadog (https://docs.datadoghq.com/logs/log_collection/javascript/). Maybe there's a clue in there.
- I think we are not logging enough information in `info` mode. For example, we should print the room ID on startup of the DO and also include the room ID in the connection request log.
- We should test ourselves whether [LogPull](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpull/) contains information about workers and durable objects for our instance. I don't have clear info on whether or whether it should not according to the docs. If it does then maybe it will have information about platform-level exceptions. If it does *not* contain such information then we should put in a feature request with Cloudflare.
- Perhaps we should prioritize rocicorp/mono#310 more highly. I had originally thought that `onDisconnect` would be based on socket state, but maybe we should do a periodic mutation and check that it is applied and synced? That would be more foolproof and is what we were proposing Noam do but maybe we should just include it in Reflect?

Not sure what else we can do. Ideas?"

This requires some API design. For (2) the most direct approach to me seems to be an event on the _server_ that can be used to make some state changes. But that feels very special case.

In the canvas app, if you scribble a bunch with the pencil tool, then copy/paste the scribble, then copy/paste all scribbles, then do that repeatedly... within about 10 or 16 copy paste cycles you notice that the copy/paste operation stops working.

Even odder, though, when you refresh the client, the data is lost entirely. It's not present in the refreshed view either.

The client side of this protocol is currently implemented in the `rep-client` directory of this repo. We don't want every project to have to include this literally, and also the implementation of this client is quite inefficient and indirect due to the fact that it has to be implemented on top of the stateless API that replicache provides.

Replicache should directly and efficiently support the multiplayer use case without any of this client boilerplate required in replidraw-do.

What to do with the stateless interface is up for debate. I have considered:

1. Pulling it into a separate repo (ala replicache-react)
2. Ditching it entirely (users have to do it themselves)
3. Having it as an optional feature of `replicache`

Currently leaning more toward 3. But in any case the goal for this bug here is that multiplayer apps don't need to copy/paste the client and that the client is efficient."

1. `wrangler dev`

This is related to https://github.com/rocicorp/replicache/issues/335 -- the client should have been told it was unknown. But also there shouldn't be a way for our server to iloop."

Note that we'll write a new snapshot if the server returns the same cookie or lmid as long as the patch is non-empty. The state associated with a lmid and a cookie is not unique. Intuitively this must be true because of out of band changes, but unfortunately it means that we can't _know_ the client has the state we intend for it to have, because a cookie does not uniquely identify a state.

In the new world we'll poke a series of updates composed of (more or less) a tuple of `(baseCookie, newCookie, lastMutationID, patch)`. We need to determine under which circumstances to accept an update, considering both the MP use case as well as the more traditional instant use cases (client does something like today's pull, maybe without a cookie).

In order to implement our billing model, we need to track the number of unique clients each customer uses Replicache with each month. 



This implies that Replicache will ping some central server on startup with an accountid/clientid pair so that we can count. Replicache generates the clientid internally already, and the accountid could be supplied as a constructor parameter.

However, we do **not** want it to be possible to accidentally (or maliciously) use someone else's account id  and charge their credit card. Therefore, accounts should be somehow tied to domains -- and you should only be able to construct Replicache with an accountid if the owner of that account intends Replicache to be used on that domain. (As a nice side effect this would allow account holders to know which domains are generating Replicache usage).

Another requirement is that we do **not** want to report domain names Replicache is used on to some central service. It's common for companies to have internal, semi-secret host names, and it would be bad practice to collect those."

# Performance

## Data Sizes
- Up to 64MB per Replicache instance

## Scan
- 650 MB/s in release mode

## Reactive Loop
100 open subscriptions, 5 of which are dirty, each of which reads 10KB of data.
With 16 MB total data, all reads refresh after a write in:
- p50: 3.5ms
- p95: 6ms
With 64 MB total data:
- p50: 3.5ms
- p95: 25ms

## Populate 1MB
- With zero indexes: 25 MB/s
- With one index: 17 MB/s
- With two indexes: 13 MB/s

## Startup
- @100mb: p95 Read first 100kb < 150ms

# Correctness

## Offline

Pending but unpushed mutations are pushed to server when back online. For example, if pending mutations are applied in a tab while offline and that tab is closed (or crashes) while offline, they are sent next time the app runs (in any tab). The very last few moments of mutations (~5s worth) before tab close/crash may be lost.
