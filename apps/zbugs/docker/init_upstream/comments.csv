50TnSSD4O2xyFGdq1L0ih,sFBw5FlZEehokCxuIpF62,1726189802000.0,"Here's a proposed schema and algorithm.

Add a new column to the change table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE ""cdc.ChangeDB"" (
  ""commitWatermark"" TEXT,
  ""watermark"" TEXT,
  ""change"" JSONB,
  PRIMARY KEY (""commitWatermark"", ""watermark"")
);
```

For normal, non-streaming replication messages, we actually know the commit watermark when we receive the `begin` message, so we can write the all columns as the messages arrive.

To add support for streaming in-progress transactions, or other CDC protocols where the commit watermark is not known at begin time, we can write a placeholder in for the commitWatermark (derived from a constant larger than the largest LSN, like `2^64 + 1`) while the transaction is pending, and then when the final commit is known, update all rows to replace that constant with the final commit.

Finally, we also have to propagate this down to the client so that watermarks look like ""commitWatermark/watermark"" so that the subscriber can properly do watermark based filtering. This will make in-progress transactions a bit trickier. Perhaps we shouldn't do forward-time filtering based on watermarks.  🤔 ",LEi7HLlfEXIZuySPGB21M

I was hitting this when testing Zeppliear

In Zeppliear we have a limit of 200 but we end up with a case where we get to `#limitedAddAll` where the size of the BTree is 201 (changing the limit to 10 hits a case where the data.size is 11):

I did some debugging and the problem seems to be that the we call tree `set` without going through the *limit function* so the tree size is larger than we expect.

The current signature is:

```ts
EntityQuery<F extends FromSet, Return = []>
```

which, in practice, looks like the following when defining functions that take queries:

```ts
function applyFilter(q: EntityQuery<{
  issue: Issue,
  label: Label
}, {
  issue: Issue,
  label: Label
}[]>) {
}
```

That's... difficult to get right.

A potential fix is to modify the `EntityQuery` type to:

```ts
EntityQuery<F extends union of entities?, Return = MakeReturn<F>>
```

Which cleans up user defined functions (like the applyFilter example) to:

```ts
function applyFilter(q: EntityQuery<Issue | Label>) {
}
```

> note: `EntityQuery<Issue | Label>` instead of `EntityQuery<[Issue, Label]>` since order should not matter.

Which, I think, is pretty obvious. 

Does this fix the issue with `EntityQuery<{foo: Foo, bar: Bar}>` being assignable to `EntityQuery<{foo: Foo}>`?
We do not want to former to be assignable to the latter unless we force the user to always use qualified names in `where`, `on`, `having`. The reason is that the type system will allow unqualified selectors for the latter but the implementation will break if the type of query is really the former at runtime.",KmQThHCHAmsWRLr0_uU1B

For each roomID, before sending it the request, it should check if it's RoomRecord indicates it is deleted, if it is it should delete the connection records and move to the next roomID.  If not proceed to send the request for the current connection.  If the returned responses is 410 deleted, this indicates the room was deleted but we failed to record it in the auth do's state, so we should fix that now, we should update the RoomRecord to indicate it is deleted and we should delete the connection records for the room.
4. The auth invalidate endpoints (authInvalidateAll, authInvalidateForRoom and authInvalidateForUser) need to be updated to deal with deleted rooms.  Similarly to 2, before sending a request to a room we should check the RoomRecord for deleted, and we should also handle 410 deleted responses from the room, updating the RoomRecords and ConnectionRecords appropriately.  *We should treat a deleted room as a successful invalidation.*

That is a nice way to ensure eventual consistency. 2 would retry if either the call to the RoomDO failed or the AuthDO RoomRecord/ConnectionRecords updates failed, correct?

I think it would allow a little simplification of revalidate/invalidate if we had been using this scheme from the beginning, but given having to deal with existing rooms I think its probably more complicated to move to this.  With this revalidate could just skip over DELETING and DELETED rooms.  However invalidate would still need to make calls to DELETING rooms (as its contract is that if the response is 200 the connections are closed, not that they will be eventually close), and would need to deal with `410 deleted` responses.

I convinced myself that this is a correct (and elegant) way to handle this. The connection cleanup code remains largely the same, the only difference being that it handles a deleted room as having returned no connections (so that they get cleaned up), and checks that the RoomRecord is marked as deleted.",LEi7HLlfEXIZuySPGB21M

After thinking about this a bit, I can see use cases for:
* Closing a room and leaving the existing connections open. (maybe?)
* Closing a room and then invalidating connections but keeping the room data for archival purposes.

However, I feel like `deleteRoom` could automatically close the room (in the AuthDO) similar to how we added the auto invalidate, so that the `deleteRoom` command can stand on its own without any of the previous steps.

I guess one gotcha is that in the case of a partial failure (e.g. the call to RoomDO#delete fails), the user is left with a closed room, which could be kind of unintuitive.

Which is likely because the latter is bounded at once-per-minute entries, while `ConnectionLifetimes` produce an entry per connection and can thus increase with lots of (short) connections.

We'll probably want to keep an eye on this and see if saving ConnectionLifetimes are worth it, given that we don't actually use the data (due to the [overcounting issue](https://www.notion.so/replicache/Usage-Tracking-Methodologies-Limitations-e94b29188b024038bfbcc183a6d88189)).

There are actually a few things that go wrong here though:

1. First thing is that `init` and `create` put the `reflect` dir in different places (`/refect` vs `/src/reflect`). Thus when `init` runs we end up in a confused state where we have two reflect directories (the old one is still there!).

2. If you run `npx reflect dev` at this point, then you have the wrong mutators for the current app (you're still looking at the `create` app, which wants to call cursor-related mutators).

---

I think the right thing here is to have both apps use the `/src/reflect` directory so that this confusion can't happen. Then it will do the right thing:

I was concerned about the deprecation errors rising to the top because I had converted those to warnings quite a while ago. It turns out that it's a case of mis-bucketing; the error reporter is putting the `dev` errors into same bucket, and until this morning these were classified as errors.

Importantly, the stuff that we classify as warnings do not get surfaced to the error reporter.  🎉 

It also has some nice features like attaching bugs and setting state of errors to `Acknowledged` and `Resolved`, re-reporting as desired if something resurfaces.

I'm enabling notifications from the Error Reporter to our #mirror-prod-alerts channel. This could conceivably replace our existing error-level alerts (though I'll keep the warning-level alerts around).

The limit appears to be for the value only:

This works:

```ts
   bindings: {
      vars: {
        ['E'.repeat(1024)]: 'H'.repeat(5120),
      },
```

But this results in an error:

```ts
   bindings: {
      vars: {
        ['E'.repeat(1024)]: 'H'.repeat(5121),
      },

```json
  code: 10054,
  error_chain: [
    {
      code: 10054,
      message: 'workers.api.error.text_binding_too_large'
    }
  ]
```

In addition, there appears to be an undocumented limit of 2712 bytes for the key name.

This works:

```ts
bindings: {
      vars: {
        ['B'.repeat(2712)]: 'A'.repeat(5120),
      },
```

But this results in an error:

```ts
bindings: {
      vars: {
        ['B'.repeat(2713)]: 'A'.repeat(5120),
      },
```


```json
code: 10100,
  error_chain: [
    {
      code: 10100,
      message: 'workers.api.error.binding_name_too_large'
    }
  ]
```

Finally, the limit does appear to apply to the UTF-8 encoded byte length. 

For two-byte characters:

```ts
// Works:
bindings: {
      vars: {
        ['M'.repeat(2712)]: '£'.repeat(2560),

// Fails:
bindings: {
      vars: {
        ['M'.repeat(2712)]: '£'.repeat(2561),
      },
 ```

For three-byte characters:

```ts
// Works:
bindings: {
      vars: {
        ['M'.repeat(2712)]: '文'.repeat(1706),
      },

I think the limit of 100 Custom domains is just part of our Free plan:

https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/limits/#custom-domains

> Custom domains
> Based on your Cloudflare plan type, a Pages project is limited to a specific number of custom domains. This limit is on a per-project basis.

 Upgrading to Pro or Business would cost $20 and $200 per month, respectively:

The silver lining here is that we should be able to overcome our limit by upgrading our plan, so we're not blocked on migrating to Workers for Platforms.

I'm still digging into mapping out a game plan for WfP, but it won't change the fact that we'll need to pay for more domains, as WfP has similar Plan-based limits on hostnames:

* reflect-server.net (Free Plan, Rocicorp LLC account): Max of 300 worker custom domains
* replicache.dev (Enterprise Plan, Rocicorp LLC account): Max of 300 worker custom domains

So indeed our limit is what Tanushree bumped us too, even for the zone that's officially on the ""Enterprise Plan"".

So moving to Workers for Platforms should indeed allow us to scale to many more hostnames. The first 100 are free, and the default max is 5000, but Enterprise customers can remove that 5000 limit by contacting sales:

What I'd prefer to avoid, however, is storing a lot of secrets in the Secret Manager because it's extra datastore management and is [relatively expensive](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager/pricing) (at least, compared to the other GCP costs,  which for our usage is pretty much free).

The rough idea I had in mind is to store a single master key in the Secret Manager, and then store a random plaintext in Firestore for each app. The REFLECT_AUTH_API_KEY for the app would be the plaintext encrypted with the master key. On that scheme we can implement key replacement by replacing the plaintext, or key rotation by storing multiple plaintexts (and having reflect accept multiple keys).

The downside to this approach is that leaking the master key puts everyone's keys at risk, but only if the plaintexts are also exposed. I think the way to address this is to have each plaintext be associated with the master key version, and if the latter is leaked, we would create a new master key/version and rotate in a new plaintext with that version. Then we'd notify everyone to switch to their new resulting API_KEY.

 Script size can impact startup because there’s more code to parse and evaluate.

The amount of actual code that we use in the libraries is not actually that large though, so I'm wondering if we're not effectively tree-shaking the new code.

Maybe @arv can figure out whether we can improve the tree shaking with the commonjs libraries we're pulling in.

- The issue is not a missing await on a promise, the ChunkNotFoundError is happening before the mutator's returned promise resolves.
- Customer was encountering ChunkNotFoundError's in Replicache 12.0.1 as well.
- In this repro with deleteBlocks, actually several calls to tx.get are hitting ChunkNotFoundErrors, but they are being collapsed to one error by Promise.all. 
- The issue seems to be related with doing parallel work in mutators.  The customer has encountered ChunkNotFoundErrors in a few mutators and has found that replacing `Promise.all` with a for loop that awaits sequentially often avoids the ChunkNotFoundError.  In this specific repro with deleteBlocks, the error can be avoided by replacing

Possible solutions:

### No mutable nodes

The motivation of allowing nodes to be mutable was for performance and memory usage. If we can prove that it is safe to mutate the Node then a `_replaceChild` (for example) is `O(1)` instead of `O(n)` where `n` is the number of nodes at that level. If we have these as immutable we have to copy the entries and create new Nodes which puts more pressure on the GC.

### Read Write Lock

Right now the BTreeWrite has a lock on the write operations. For read, we tried to prevent having an RWLock by checking if the tree changed and then start over in the case of a change.

My thinking is that we should make the nodes immutable because that gives me confidence that things are working correctly.

To alleviate the performance regression we can actually remove the lock in `put` (and `delete`/`clear`). The lock on `put` is there because:

```ts
  /**
   * This rw lock is used to ensure we do not mutate the btree in parallel. It
   * would be a problem if we didn't have the lock in cases like this:
   *
   * ```ts
   * const p1 = tree.put('a', 0);
   * const p2 = tree.put('b', 1);
   * await p1;
   * await p2;
   * ```
   *
   * because both `p1` and `p2` would start from the old root hash but a put
   * changes the root hash so the two concurrent puts would lead to only one of
   * them actually working, and it is not deterministic which one would finish
   * last.
   */
```

What we can do instead is that we can detect if the root hash changed and if it did we start over. That approach is already used in `scan`. The case where this gets slower is when you do a lot of parallel `put`s.",0Pa2nb7EDr1AfDVXIp8W3

* Add notion of special reserved ""system"" keyspaces (this would also be useful for other theorized features, such as local-only keys)
* The system keyspace starts with `""-/""`. (This is a breaking change but whatevs)
* The initially supported system keyspace is the ""presence"" keyspace: `""-/p/<client-id>""`.
* The Reflect system maintains two invariants for the presence keyspace:
  1. Client C1 can always access its own presence keys (online, offline, whatever)
  2. Client C2 can only access C1's presence keys when C1 is connected

In other words, the server only sends C1's presences keys to C2 when C1 is connected. When C1 is disconnected, the server sends deletes to C2 for C1's presence keys. But the server always sends C1's presence keys to C1.

---

Let's test this strawperson against the goals:

> associate state with clients/users that are connected

Presence state is associated with clients by definition. Per-user state would have to be implemented by app code. Presence state could indicate which user it is for, and then some counter or timestamp could be used to track which client a user is currently at.

We could use this same pattern to provide user presence in the future if necessary.

> automatically delete this state when clients disconnect

Yes. And further, doesn't delete it locally which is required for cursors to work consistently while disconnected.

> doesn't get confused by mutation recovery

@grgbkr will have to verify this, but I think we are good.

Mutations to presence state sent by mutation recovery *will write* to presence state for disconnected clients on the server, as normal. However, writes to presence state for disconnected clients won't be visible to other clients.

> integrates naturally with persisted state

This namespace idea is originally nate white's, and although using strings in the keys feels a little hacky, it integrates beautifully with all of the existing API.

Also note that this presence state as proposed here *is normal Reflect state*. It gets persisted to IDB as normal, it gets written to durable objects, normally, etc. This means that cross-tab presences while offline will just automatically work.

The deletion of presence state when a client disconnects isn't a function of the state being ephemeral on the server, it's a function of a specific delete process that runs when the client disappears.

It is true that presence state often doesn't need to be written so aggressively, both on client and server, but that can be handled separately...

> don't bother persisting this state locally

We do persist the state locally. And as above, maybe this is a good thing (so cross-tab presence works).

> don't bother resending changes related to this state when reconnecting from offline

We would send when reconnecting. However, sending too much unneeded data when reconnecting can be handled separately by #769. Almost all presence mutations would typically be droppable under evenflow, but we still preserve the ability to have non-droppable presence mutations.",U5JpbO_DuJsVSdksk839i

I think this makes sense ideally, but it doesn't seem like a very high priority. There will likely be other UI changes apps want to make to run offline, this just being one. They can detect when they are offline and hide the presence UI if they want to already. I think we should skip for v1 of presence.",U5JpbO_DuJsVSdksk839i

If we have a tristate (disconnected, connecting and connected) it would only seem fair that we report the state as connection during a reconnect.

But let's think about what we actually want to report:

State | ConnectionState | Error Count | What we want to report
-- | -- | -- | --
Startup | disconnected | 0 | online
Connecting | connecting | 0 | previous state
Connected | connected | 0 | online
Auth Error | disconnected, connecting | 0 | previous state
Auth Error, repeated | disconnected, connecting | 1 | offline
Connect timed out | disconnected | 1 | offline
Ping timed out | disconnected | 1 | offline
Tab hidden (with timeout) | disconnected | 0 | offline
Tab shown | connecting | 0 | previous state?

I think we could keep things the way they are with slight tweak. The value of online can be `!tabHidden && errorCount === 0`. We would also ""set"" this when we set the connectionState to Connecting. That means that when we startup we would be online. When we come back from a hidden tab we will also treat that as being online.

Next question: I see that we use a Gauge for recording connection times. While it at first seemed odd to me, I understand now that we're trying to track two things at the same time: (1) the number of open connections along with (2) the time they took to connect.

However, for timing of short-lived events like a LogFunction or auth_time, I was thinking that it makes more sense as a Distribution, at least according to the [DD docs](https://docs.datadoghq.com/metrics/#metric-types-and-real-time-metrics-visibility).

I think the decision to use a gauge was driven by what datadog has api support for. But also an interesting consideration is we want to be super careful to not overcount in situations like retry loops. That is why we have this setup where we store the _last value_ for some measure and report that every time period.

These claims are accessible (after authentication) both from the client-side and the server-side, as they are encoded in the user's JWT.

As such, it would be elegant to have the application pass the same user `context` object (containing `userID`, `claims`, and whatever else the application desires to make its authorization decisions) into the initialization of the client, and from the auth response of the `authenticateAndAuthorize` callback in the worker. Then the mutator logic can be the same on the client and server side (the former of which assumes what behavior is allowed, and the latter of which does the actual enforcement). In this way replicache / reflect provide a conduit for arbitrary information from the application's auth code to its mutation code, in both the client and server environments.

async function fooButOnlyIfAdmin(tx: WriteTransaction) {
  if (tx.context?.isAdmin) {
    await foo();

The nice thing about Reflect is because it has authoritative server the client doesn't _need_ to do the same thing as the server. If this is an edge case that should not be triggered except by malicious users, then it doesn't matter what the ux is.

We don't need to bend over backwards to have the mutators always compute the exact same thing on the client, they don't have to be pure.

lVBX4uxTo_isRki08m1bx,ATECZurt08wsexQOT0rCG,1679611909000.0,"cc @grgbkr -- I checked this out with Jesse. For some reason with current trunk builds, and only on --local mode, mutations stay pending forever. The server never decides to run them.

If you reboot the server then it *does* find the mutations and run them.

This doesn't happen with current npm build, nor does it happen in trunk builds without --local.

Smells very much related to clock changes to me. Updated wrangler but didn't help. We tried running --experimental-local, but it doens't seem to be working at all right now (server crashes at startup with some npm inssue).

We will have to figure out something for alpha because we just decided to recommend people use --local so we don't have to fix https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/issues/388#issuecomment-1476942996.",U5JpbO_DuJsVSdksk839i

To reproduce, pull this branch then:

- `cp .env.example .env` (if you have no `.env`)
- `cp .dev.vars.example .dev.vars` (if you have no `.dev.vars`)
- `npm i`
- `npm run dev-worker`

Then in a separate console

- `./create-room.sh`
- `npm run dev`
- open http://localhost:5173/

Note that you can create todos, and they don't appear until the server confirms them ([this is the commit that forces server confirmation](https://github.com/rocicorp/reflect-todo/commit/e565f700cfb310ea97eae440b82d88b298e1ae0f)).
Now to reproduce the issue, stop both consoles, then

- `npm run dev-worker-local`

and in a new console,

- `./create-room.sh`
- `npm run dev`

Now open http://localhost:5173/ and see that when you try to add a TODO it isn't created.

Observe that the mutator is sent to the server, it just doesn't run it.

xfFoporqWCrw6Ia7aHcqn,ATECZurt08wsexQOT0rCG,1679683211000.0,"FWIW, I've also been seeing (and I believe it may have been like this since I started on this project) that `Script modified, context reset` will run when I change files that are not dependencies of `worker/index.ts` - this means that when I change any frontend file, the reflect db will be wiped, and baseCookie will be unrecognized.

This was less of a blocker when doing pure FE iteration, but when working on bots, it makes it pretty rough. I've also been seeing exceptions on reconnect, so most of the time even reloading will wipe the db locally.

I've seen some other reports of this (https://community.cloudflare.com/t/script-modified-context-reset-during-developement/384304) and believe it to be on cloudflare's side, and I haven't put any time into cleanly reproducing the reload crash, so I don't think anything here is directly actionable, just mentioning it so we all know what the DX is at the moment.

My workaround for now is to just use the reflect libs from npm in dev, and use the tarballs in prod, since things are ok there, so I'm not blocked.",LbwlTBjAEnspiYgjZVt-i

One take away from this still failing when we put a single lock around them is that it is not the interleaving of persists/refreshes that causes the trouble.

It could still be the interleaving of the memdag with mutations and pull...

In particular its hard to get the subscribe/watch behavior correct.

I think roughly the best we can do is to delete local replicache state and
call a callback that by default reloads the page.  We could maybe do one
better, by transparently closing/deleting/reopening, if no watches have
been fired, but it seems likely to be buggy.

async function createReflectServer(opts: CreateReflectServerOptions) {

    // Too clever to overload?
    auth: async () => {

    logSink,

  // rs is a fully functioning Reflect-like thing 🤯.
  // - you can call `mutate.foo` on it (it will get queued in the game loop)
  // - you can call `subscribe` and get notifs when things change (ie to sync with
  //   external systems, maintain computed state, whatever)
  // - you can set timers or call fetch in the global scope and call mutators later!
  // - you can use libraries against it that are designed for the `Reflect` or
  //   `Replicache` interface.

  // The runtime arranges to call your mutators when messages come in.
  // The return type of `createReflectServer` is `extends ReflectServer<T>`, so
  // you can also *extend* Reflect and add your own state.

I was being lazy/imprecise with my writing when I said: `// Gets called *once* when the server starts.` Sorry that's happened a few times, I'll try to be more precise in the future since we're async.

Often, the worker, roomDO, and authDO can be in separate isolates or on different machines. So in that case, it is not possible for the options callback to get called only once per `createReflectServer`.

What i really meant was ""Gets called once per worker/DO, the first time the worker/DO needs the options"".

What isn't clear to me is how this interacts with isolates. If it wasn't for isolates the options object would be shared between these 4 cases. The options object is part of a closure.

In the simple case where there's one just user then yes, the worker, authdo, and roomdo will all be in same isolate.

But if there are multiple users in a room, the worker and roomdo can easily be in different isolates since CF will spawn a new worker close to where user 2 is, even if user 1 already has their own worker.

my current idea is:
add schemaVersion to ReflectServerOptions, if the schemaVersion differs from what is stored on startup call a customer provided schemaVersionChangeHandler passing it a WriteTransaction (or a WriteTransaction factory).  Don't accept connections until the schemaVersionChangeHandler completes
add schemaVersion as a param to socket connect, and reject connections if the schemaVersion doesn't match server's current version

We want to shuffle the demo on load so the user gets a nice initial state.

We could wait until we get the initial state, delay displaying anything, and if there are no non-bot users shuffle. But there is a small chance that there is some other user also joining at that moment, and that user will see the state suddenly shuffle.

To fix that issue we could do the shuffle server-side. So: we wait to display anything, do a mutation that shuffles the demo, but only if nobody is present, and wait for that mutation to round-trip through the server. But in that case, we have to wait for the mutation to round trip, delaying startup.

The best place to do this shuffle would be on the server, right as a user is connecting. We can see at that moment if they are the only one present and if they they are we shuffle the demo just before they sync their initial state.",U5JpbO_DuJsVSdksk839i

This last requirement differs from the existing behavior and can be used in interesting ways; I want to flesh out my thoughts and confirm that we're all on the same page.

Currently, a connection can be closed early (in `handleConnection()`) due to errors originating from the contents of the connect request: bad request format, invalid connection group id, invalid lmid, invalid base cookie. Importantly, a client was always able to fix its error and retry the connect.

Closing a connection due to an error from the `connectHandler` introduces a new scenario in which the connection can be closed due to situations outside of the control of the client. I can see this as a desired feature (e.g. disallowing connections for rooms that are too full), but it is, I believe, a new class of behavior and I wanted to confirm is intended.

One of the reasons I ask is that @grgbkr's initial implementation (granted, done before @aboodman listed these more detailed requirements) plumbs the `connectHandler` down into a callback where it's not straightforward to close the connection (i.e. [`processFrame()`](https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/pull/494/files#diff-6821aedf9ef09ff065dbf002dc72a7927e474df1876b02677ac20b81aba73480R47)). I presume he did this to be symmetric with the `disconnectHandler`, but I also imagine that he didn't have this close-connection-on-error behavior in mind.

In summary, two questions:
* @aboodman: Can you confirm that we want the `connectHandler` to be able reject incoming connections due to non-connection-related scenarios? (fwiw, it makes for an interesting capability but does add a bit more complexity to the code when compared to simply logging/ignoring the errors)

The main purpose of `connectHandler` that I envision is ensuring certain state exists for a connection before it proceeds. If we ignore errors and proceed then this invariant is destroyed.

You're right to point out that it's not symmetrical with `disconnectHandler`. We cannot offer the same level of guarantee that `disconnectHandler` completes, unless we are willing to kill the entire rooms forever if `disconnectHandler` fails.

So it may be that the best way to prevent any client-mutations in the face of an error-returning `connectHandler` is to synchronously run the connectHandler in `handleConnect()` before accepting the connection and registering the websocket.

I think it's a decent (though maybe not ideal) foundation on which to build understandability for reps and reflect server. I think the next steps would be to address the scale issue described above by adding aggregation and then to develop the observability/monitoring/alerting plan for reflect (and later, reps) which is some combination of the poorly described and factored https://github.com/rocicorp/reflect-server/issues/193 and https://github.com/rocicorp/reflect-server/issues/60. I think that with a couple of engineer-weeks one could:
- define the minimal set of metrics one would like to keep for reflect-server (eg request error rate or ws message error rate, ws msg latency, request count, storage write latency distribution, auth failures rate, game loop lag, etc/whatever)
- add whatever new metric types one needs for these (likely: rate, count, maybe set for clientids) and integrate with reflect-server
- add basic dashboards
- prototype alerting by adding some alerts on the above to whatever the most trafficked demo app that there is. 

This would provide a pretty good guide for monitoring reps when the time comes.

I see that it is awkward to special case this one class of error behavior. Sorry for not thinking this through. I change my mind: all classes of server errors should leave Reflect ""open"" so the app can continue working, and it should try and retry in the background.

I still feel a little sad about this though:

```ts
const rep = new Reflect({
  apiKey,
  roomID,
  mutators,
  authToken: () => myConstantAuthToken
})
```

... for the very common case where user doesn't handle reauth. It's just a tiny bit of friction that makes the dx feel less inviting when people are first trying the product.

A few simple fixes I can imagine:

1. authToken can be a string or a function. In the string case a function returning the string is implied.
2. There's a separate reauth API
3. Aaron is being unnecessarily prissy

I guess of these I like 1 the best.

For the question of retrying, I think we can integrate retrying auth into the normal exponential backoff?

If the client fails auth on the server-side, we send an error and close the connection. The client sees that the error is auth related and internally clears the auth token. Exponential backoff happens normally. On next connection, client sees auth token is null and calls `authToken()` function.

I don't think it's that simple. There are places that an input gate would not help us because there is a race with incoming requests while no storage operation is in flight, eg when updating a room. If someone wants to rip the lock out for reasons of perceived complexity then they need to do a careful analysis of what the locks are doing and determine which can be replaced.

However, personally, I'm *far* more comfortable reasoning about traditional locks than I am about the input gate. It is totally not clear to me that we will have fewer bugs and spend less time on the code if we try to eliminate locking in favor of gates. 

Greg and I had a discussion about the locking in the DOs and while neither of us was thrilled with having it in there we were convinced we needed it for correctness and that if it became an actual problem for throughput or complexity then we would revisit.

However we cannot rule out that this client was legitimately offline because at this time we didn't have the `isOnline` log line, and the browser was open for awhile before. Perhaps network blip or something:

I don't see anything wrong with these logs. It just seems to take awhile for the request to make it to the server sometimes. These are the two most egregious examples from this log set, but that same roomID `G1LcejpAqDj2vE4voT2Cgzd-2Xi4lX_x` from last example has two other cases where client took 40s to connect:

Interestingly we also see that same HK user from rocicorp/mono#276 (room `ka8iwY3wtfbQ4M6t8KYPWA8bQ4f9xBWd`) show up here with some connections that take ~14s:

Another really interesting pattern is that these logs span: `2022-12-15T21:29:33.124Z` to `2022-12-16T02:29:57.425Z`, but the longest example of connections seem to cluster around `~2022-12-15T22:00:00Z`:

There were a lot of server starts then, but also other times, but we don't see the long connection times at other places where server starts were higher:

only works when rooms are completely lost.

It is also common to just lose state changes for some recent versions.  This is exactly what happens if you start wrangler dev, access an existing room, make some changes, and then restart wrangler dev. 

To address both think we could change cookies to be a {id: uuid, version: number}, and keep a history of cookies on the server. Then when a client with existing state for a room connects, the room-do can validate if the cookie it is connecting with is in its cookie history.

... and I did manually test that these logs showed up (in the console, not in datadog) when I added the patch.

Confirming the theory that these events just aren't happening, there are some relevant server-side logs that also aren't happening (I confirmed correct server version running too):

However, it certainly seems the reconnect loops are still happening. If we search for ""disconnecting"" and count by client IP:

`198.203.181.181` is having almost 10x as much trouble as anyone else over the past day.

This client had two different documents open for a total of 6 hours today and reconnected every 2s the entire time:

<img width=""1512"" alt=""Screen Shot 2022-12-12 at 11 31 15 PM"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80388/207280368-09a7f238-a6f7-4393-8b08-4386f50ffea0.png"">

It looks to me like this client genuinely could not connect. Perhaps they were offline this entire time and the datadog client queues up the messages to send later?

But it's suspicious to me that there is not a *single* message from either of these rooms. The user was online at one time enough to get the code for the app. But they could never connect to the server.

Nothing looks particularly odd about their UA:

Let's look at the next most common client sending ""disconnecting"" messages. The next most client is almost 1/10 the frequency:

<img width=""1109"" alt=""Screen Shot 2022-12-12 at 11 39 38 PM"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80388/207282652-0aa81231-3fae-4ada-8b96-1d1243e8d2d6.png"">

This pattern looks much healthier, the gaps between ""connected"" and ""disconnecting"" are much longer:

The third example is back to the bad pattern though. Reconnect loop:

However, the client with the most number of ""disconnecting..."" messages in the last 4 hours is still not generating any server logs:

Confirming, other rooms *do* show server logs:

So it seems that we still have some clients who never generate a single log message from our server. It's not perfectly clear to me how common this is because a client in this state will generate ""disconnecting"" messages continuously. But let's try a few more.

Second most client in disconnecting messages:

<img width=""1401"" alt=""Screen Shot 2022-12-14 at 8 59 51 AM"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80388/207688198-427f016e-f72e-4f39-a398-aa613eac7441.png"">

Interesting thing here the server *does* log messages for this client. It's a fairly consistent pattern:

<img width=""1403"" alt=""Screen Shot 2022-12-14 at 9 03 04 AM"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80388/207689228-132e04f9-4592-4485-bfd2-d6e4451d2f74.png"">

Here's an example of the pattern. These are all log lines for room `9E4L_hoi1n9HQlfXq6kRSNxmaN-8xCsA` associated with the `ts` querystring field `10213662`.

The first entry is actually from the auth DO:

I think this is just because all the workers are separate concurrent processes, so the order across workers is not realtime. Anyway, next one is the worker:

The roomdo receives the request:

Then the pattern repeats with the authdo receiving a new request with a different timestamp:

The client with the third most number of ""disconnecting"" messages is seeing the second pattern. Log messages on server, but connection doesn't last long.

j3xIlOv-eBquWIZfp7Q4m,hMyw9x6yCtZTIrRy-p3sx,1671092081000.0,"I downloaded a bunch of logs from datadog in order to do offline-processing. The code is in https://github.com/rocicorp/monday-log-processing.

I processed logs from 2022-12-14T0500 to 2022-12-14T2100 HST (2022-12-14T1700 to 2022-12-15T0900 Israel).

Here's the summary:

* 405 distinct client IPs
* 233 client IPs experienced at least one disconnect [0]
* 17 (4.2%) client IPs never connected (""non-connecting IPs"")
* 9 distinct *rooms* never connect (""non-connecting rooms"") [1]
* 4 non-connecting rooms have zero server logs [2]
* 2 non-connecting rooms are missing their web socket upgrade header [3]
* 3 non-connecting rooms are still a mystery

[0] Remember that disconnects in of themselves are not unexpected or problematic, it only matters when they are not reconnecting or thrashing.

[1] For this dataset the server doesn't have client IPs and the client doesn't always have client IDs, so there is no way to tie the client/server logs together other than room. Generally, I think, each user is in their own room. So the fact that there are fewer non-connecting rooms than IPs indicates to me that some users who could not connect moved IPs. So perhaps the real number of non-connecting users is more like 9/405 (~2%).

[2] This indicates that the web socket request never made it to the server at all. Perhaps these users were genuinely offline, or some other networking related situation is happening.

[3] This indicates that some system between the browser and the server (ie a corp proxy) is messing with the connection

4g2M_553MgvMt3XwUYQ-y,hMyw9x6yCtZTIrRy-p3sx,1671224917000.0,"OK, armed with the new logging (thanks @noamackerman) I re-ran this analysis in terms of unique clientID and cient IP addresses.

These logs were from 20221215T1200 to 20221215T1630 HST.

* unique client IP addresses: 98
* unique client IDs: 225
* IPs addresses that never connect: 4 (~4%)
* client IDs that never connect: 12 (~5%)

Most of the clientIDs are spurious results. They are examples of a pattern where extra Reflect instances are created by the app and immediately destroyed. The same IP address does connect concurrently with a different Reflect instance.

See for example clientID: 13599658

There is only one occurrence of a log line (client or server for this client ID):

<img width=""1376"" alt=""Screen Shot 2022-12-16 at 9 51 11 AM"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80388/208177963-0c164f0a-b4b4-405e-8559-dabdd7380ac9.png"">

The reason is because the very first few log lines from a client unfortunately don't have their client ID associated. However, if we filter on their IP address in this window, we can get a sense for what's going on:

<img width=""1377"" alt=""Screen Shot 2022-12-16 at 9 53 53 AM"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80388/208178405-88732d08-7f54-4348-a953-eb8b51808407.png"">

There are two connections in quick succession in the same room from same IP for some reason. The second one gets through and connects normally. The first one never has its request hit the server at all. My guess is a React thing, this looks like the useEffect that instantiates Reflect happening twice, like what would happen in dev. Do ya'll have a developer in NA using opera 😆? If not maybe under some circumstances Monday instantiates Reflect twice in succession? I feel like I've seen this elsewhere in the logs form time to time.

Anyway long story short, this client is not problematic. Most of the clientIDs that don't connect fit this pattern.

So it's actually more useful to look at the IP addresses. There are four that don't connect.

*180.208.59.157*

This is the same one we saw the other day in China. Fascinatingly this same user (by way of room ID) connected later from Hong Kong and succeeded!

So this IP legit can't use web sockets.

*177.244.53.34*

This user is in Mexico. Their cable provider doesn't seem weird to me. Their requests make it to the server but seem to be terminated moments later each time.

*131.125.11.1*

This user is in New Jersey using business internet. We only ever see three logs from their room, all client-side. It appears they cannot make socket requests.

*46.117.249.75* 

This user is in Tel Aviv. They appear to not be able to connect. The connection succeeds from server perspective but never from client. 30m later, the server gets a close event 🤔.

So I think the takeaways are:

* From this dataset, 4 IPs of 98 could not connect.
* We should do this analysis with ~1 week of data to see if this 4% figure holds.
* Roci should check if this 4% figure matches others using sockets.
* Roci should implement an HTTP fallback if these figures hold.",U5JpbO_DuJsVSdksk839i

4gOcEc-RUd-VhmFQrjulC,fJqY8ULYP-qtTqULYnFfq,1664845610000.0,"OK I've been working through the history here. Some notes:

- The `persistPullLock` was added at 345df2b3594352dcd6cab64b58956711473892ee.
- This was done because of https://app.slack.com/client/TMQQ9DWPQ/C013XFG80JC/thread/C013XFG80JC-1651685554.718029. Repliear was hitting a check in `maybeEndPull()` that was checking the sync head had not moved since pull began.
- This check dates all the way back to the first impl of pull! In Rust! https://github.com/rocicorp/repc/blob/273101caffa6fc389957c9fa24df828e9afe89a6/src/sync/pull.rs#L221
- The check makes sense in context: Back then, the sync (and main!) heads were shared across tabs. and the way rebase worked, it would gather a list of commits that needed to be rebased (from main head) that weren't rebased yet on sync head, then return them to the JS to rebase. When returning the lock on IDB was released. This check prevents `maybe_end_try_pull` from continuing if some other pull in a different tab had begun in the meantime and changed the sync head.
- But in the context of SDD, I think the check stopped being a real necessary thing for correctness and became more of an internal assert/sanity check. Because in SDD the sync head was a part of memdag and so by cannot be accessed or modified by some other process.
- Except that then `persist()` was added and actually tripped the sanity check. Because the goal of persist is to transform temporary hashes to permanent hashes, and persist can happen in the gap between `beginPull()` and `maybeEndPull()`. This modifies the hash in the sync head, triggering the error.

So it seems to me we can and should remove both the `persistPullLock` and the sanity check here https://github.com/rocicorp/replicache-internal/blob/main/src/sync/pull.ts#L641. Once we remove both, we should test the case in Repliar that originally motivated this change and see whether it still works: https://rocicorp.slack.com/archives/C013XFG80JC/p1664829629149959?thread_ts=1664815353.385429&cid=C013XFG80JC

Alternately, we could remove temp hashes from SDD. Then we can remove the `persistPullLock` and the sanity check should keep working even when persist and pull interleave.

Separately I think we need to do a group code review of sync. Reading through this I feel like this has gotten a bit grotty through many refactorings and I worry that parts of it no longer make sense. Perhaps this should happen after DD31 lands and the SDD branches are removed.",U5JpbO_DuJsVSdksk839i

I do not know how this mutex could affect the DOM `Request.json()` method. But if the json method didn't return for awhile (for other reasons, such as my task prioritization theory) then that would hold the  `persistPullLock` open which would prevent persist from happening.

- please note: do not overlook the N^2 communication complexity of poke-per-mutation which adds up really really quick. Eg 30 users in a room with 10% sending a mutation per frame implies at the server an incoming mutation rate of 3 mutations per frame which results in 3*30=90 outgoing messages per frame. That's 90 messages * 60 frames per second = 5400 outgoing messages per second which would consume a huge and undesirable amount of cpu (see above, but rate of <=2000 is more prudent)

YMSe3qKT5OWYTbS3kbMBG,as14BXsx9wjU8D_w7Swxk,1672871724000.0,"I just read through all this and these notes are surprisingly still current and useful!

A few follow-up notes. I think 4kb per poke is way too high of an estimate. The typical poke is a mouse movement update, it's going to be tiny. Here's a sample from replidraw:

```
[""poke"",{""baseCookie"":147,""cookie"":148,""lastMutationID"":260,""patch"":[{""op"":""put"",""key"":""client-state-5026c476-d373-4376-82d3-9f26875b78ab"",""value"":{""overID"":"""",""selectedID"":""teBpwxAVPo-6_j0RmXBqB"",""userInfo"":{""avatar"":""🐣"",""name"":""Chick"",""color"":""#f94144""},""cursor"":{""x"":1185,""y"":274}}}],""timestamp"":1672870745932}]
```

This is 314 bytes. If we say 512 bytes is more typical then maybe we can send 4kb/512*2000 = 8000 messages per second. In that case our 30 users in a room example above works!

And there's obviously a lot of room to reduce the size of this message! Just adding snappy compression might get it to 200 bytes!

===

Also - even if we do one poke-per-server-frame, we might not end up sending that much less data. If we are assuming that multiple clients are moving in each frame then a change from two active clients would look like:

```
[""poke"",{""baseCookie"":147,""cookie"":148,""lastMutationID"":260,""patch"":[{""op"":""put"",""key"":""client-state-5026c476-d373-4376-82d3-9f26875b78ab"",""value"":{""overID"":"""",""selectedID"":""teBpwxAVPo-6_j0RmXBqB"",""userInfo"":{""avatar"":""🐣"",""name"":""Chick"",""color"":""#f94144""},""cursor"":{""x"":1185,""y"":274}}}],""timestamp"":1672870745932},{""op"":""put"",""key"":""client-state-5026c476-d373-4376-82d3-9f26875b78ab"",""value"":{""overID"":"""",""selectedID"":""teBpwxAVPo-6_j0RmXBqB"",""userInfo"":{""avatar"":""🐣"",""name"":""Chick"",""color"":""#f94144""},""cursor"":{""x"":1185,""y"":274}}}],""timestamp"":1672870745932}]
```

~560 bytes.

If the main cost of sending data over the socket is just total bytes sent (if there's no overhead per-message) then we don't win much by sending one poke per server-frame.

===

I continue to be open to the idea of starting out doing one-poke-per-server-frame and seeing how that goes. The server timer will flex a bit but hopefully not too badly. Also because of the way we are constrained to replay messages in the order they were processed by the server there is a natural limit to how much client-side timestamps can help.

If a source client glitches badly and delivers a message to the server very late, then other mutations will run before it, and the receive clients will *have* to play those pokes in that order no matter how much buffering they do.

===

I could see either of these approaches working. I think slight bias for poke-per-mutation because (a) no reliance on server clock, (b) don't see data size being significantly less + (c) assuming there's no difference between sending more data in less messages or less data in more messages.",U5JpbO_DuJsVSdksk839i

Say we have 10 clients moving continuously at 60fps. So we need to send `60*10*10` ~= 6k pokes per second. But actually we can group all pokes that need to go to a single client together into a single message every 4 frames.

So every four frames, each client will receive 10 pokes for each of the four frames as one socket message. So the DO is really only sending `6000/40` ~= 150 messages / second (!?)

If the average poke really is 500b, this means in this scenarios, these socket messages will be fat!: 500b*40 = 20kb! But I think that's probably fine, maybe even better than what we're doing. Even with 30 clients moving continuously the messages are 60kb each. And we can always optimize the messages if that starts to become an issue.",U5JpbO_DuJsVSdksk839i

i think yes, the implication is that we should do that or something like that. which is why this task feels to me like rewriting the game loop, as opposed to a fundamentally different thing. but whatever about the nomenclature it seems like it should work at the scale we are talking about (even in the extreme example you give which we know is pushing the perf edge like a vercel conf experience). will be interesting to see how the client replay logic pans out, there are a lot of interesting edge cases (delayed source client sends followed by realtime sends, delayed receipt by the receiving client followed by bursts of realtime mutations, etc).

-        await tx.put(String(i), updates);

2. The click handler does not await the mutator so the numbers being printed has no real significance. The log is also including the download time. Fixing these things gives us `Put time: 773` which is much more inline with our performance metrics.

3. `getSizeOfValue` is a bottle neck here. `getSizeOfValue` is really just an approximation and it is used as a heuristic to determine how to partition the B+Tree as well as to determine how much of the data to cache in memory. One possible short term solution is to compute an average for the N first entries of arrays/objects and use the average of that as the basis for the size of the whole array/object.

0. I still see times 2.5-3x slower than expected by perf test. If you are seeing times like 600ms, perhaps it's because your computer is faster. What times do you see locally for the populate 1024x1000 test? Is it 30ms like the continuous test sees, or something significantly faster?
1. A huge percent of the time in your new trace is in defensive deep clones for the argument to mutate and put.
2. We actually clone the entire dataset *twice* - once to protect mutate, and then again to protect put!
3. We have to find a way to get these defensive copies off for tom. Maybe the right thing is that in release mode we don't defensive copy ever. We just rely on typescript and documentation. And in dev mode we do the defensive copies. Didn't we do something like this for read already?
4. Maybe copy isn't even the right thing -- maybe in dev mode we should do deepFreeze, not deepClone so that user gets an error when they modify something they are not supposed to in read-only.
5. Hash is also a huge cost here. Can we get the uuid change in sooner?
6. Regarding getSizeOfValue() I still see it contributing meaningful to the trace 4-10% depending on what part you're looking at. How can that be possible if it was returning a constant value?

That's all. I think overall these are very exciting results as it means there are very easy low hanging fruit to *massively* improve populate. Let's make some of these changes and make a customer stoked! I think it would be epic for Tom to be able to use 100MB files in his app.

x6MUiBrXrLaRx_4XNA-0Y,kMImdqcMi36dGL9LePfCX,1663664844000.0,"Some comments...

## getSizeOfValue

The getSizeOfValue is strange. Must have uploaded the wrong trace? Here is a new one: [Profile-20220920T095422.json.zip](https://github.com/rocicorp/replicache-internal/files/9605333/Profile-20220920T095422.json.zip) I think the trace I uploaded was with getSizeOfValue using an average for arrays and objects.

## deepClone

deepClone is unfortunate. In this case we do a double deepClone which is even more unfortunate. Good catch.

This is a longstanding issue. You've argued that you want to be able to mutate the arguments passed into mutators and you've also argued that you want to mutate the return values from get/scan in a mutator. To allow that we have two options:
1. Deep clone
2. Proxy to do copy on write. A while back I tried using Immer to get a sense for the performance implications and it was slower than deep clone. Maybe worth looking at something more specific than immer?

I still think we should freeze things. Keep them frozen in debug and skip the freeze in release. One benefit of using freeze is that we can quickly check if something is already frozen to skip the deep freeze. There is no way to similarly check if an object was previously cloned.

### More about the double clone

One clone is needed to clone the argument when we rebase. This is so that the data we store in the LazyStore is not mutated. This clone could be removed when the mutator is called manually. The other clone is for when putting data into the LazyStore.

## Speed 

TMWC's test: I'm getting 611 ms for 105MB => ~200MB/s. I made sure that I disabled all the asserts (src/config isProd=true)

For the perf tests I'm seeing  ~100MB/s with the stubbed out getSizeOfValue

The difference is probably the shape of the objects but I'm not certain yet.


## Hash

I think we can change to UUIDs now. It is not a format change since we never validate hashes

Agreed on spirit of doing min we can get away with. I think we can't have the clients re-creating rooms accidentally as it would be very confusing, incorrect, and could even violate spirit of this feature request.

Right now `reflect-server` implicitly creates room on connection so I think something minimally has to be done about this path. Like right this second if you delete a room and a client is connected, I believe the clients will reconnect and then other bad things will happen (#152).

Yeah agree we 100% need to prevent room re-creation. I was referring to deletion of deleted room data from clients. If we can skip doing that, that seems like less work. 

As scoped, we are saying that when we get the call to delete a room we transactionally:
- log all users out of that room
- tell the room to delete all its data, and ensure it completes
- remove all connection records for the room
- record that the room is deleted

Sure, but it's specifically called out in the docs that `storage. deleteAll` might not complete in a single call for rooms that store a lot of data, and should be called again and it will pick up deleting where it left off the previous time. If deleteAll doesn't complete we could have the customer could re-call the api but that leaves a window where the room still exists but is in a totally broken state with some but not all its data deleted, and clients can still connect to it. Seems better to just kill the room transactionally by repeating the call to deleteAll if it doesn't complete, and if that turns out to be a perf problem in reality then we can deal with it.

_qdGAF7EiThTE6o2d8tos,k-IHB2q8Ri_TqRr2SVE5g,1667437173000.0,"I took a look at what's required here and the only thing not already covered is that we need to switch how we derive DO object IDs (the things you pass to the namespace to get a stub). We currently use `roomDO.idFromName(roomName)` and we need to move to `roomDO.newUniqueId()` because only `newUniqueId` supports creating DOs that stay in the EU. So we'll need to keep a mapping from room name to object ID so that we can take a roomName that is passed into `connect` or whatever and look up its object ID, which is required to get a stub. 

In order to support existing rooms that monday created with `idFromName` we have a choice. Option 1 is have monday call an endpoint that creates `room name => object ID` records for existing rooms on a one time basis. Option 2 is to overload how object ID is derived from a roomName, either by lookup (for new rooms) or via `idFromName` (for old rooms). This involves a helper that can distinguish between those two kinds of rooms. I have done things like (2) in the past because it is easier and I'm pretty sure I regretted it each time. So I'm probably going to do (1). 

---
So in summary what needs to happen here is:
- [ ] in the authDO introduce a `roomRecordMap` which maps from `roomName (string) => RoomRecord` where `RoomRecord` holds the `objectID` and a `status` bit (open, closed, deleted).
- [ ] add a `createRoom(roomName: string)` endpoint that adds an entry to `roomRecordMap` and remove implicit creation from `connect`. Ensure `createRoom` errors if a record for the given `roomName` already exists.
- [ ] add `createRoom` call to reflect client
- [ ]  add a migration endpoint that [enumerates existing DO instances via this api](https://api.cloudflare.com/#durable-objects-namespace-list-objects) (namespace id gotten from [this api](https://api.cloudflare.com/#durable-objects-namespace-list-namespaces)) and then creates a `RoomRecord`s for each, mapping room name to `idFromName`-derived object id. This call will need to take the customer's CF api token and account id as parameters.

(at this point we could release the breaking change; what comes after could come in a second release that enables data deletion)

- [ ] extend creating a room to support rooms that need to stay in the EU `createRoom(roomName: string, jurisdiction: undefined|'eu')`, pass that bit into DO instantiation, and keep it in the `RoomRecord`.
-  [ ] add an endpoint to ""close"" a room by logging everyone out of it and changing its `RoomRecord` status to closed. Have `connect` only accept connections to rooms that are open.
-  [ ] add an endpoint to delete a room. The room must first be closed. When we delete a room we delete all its data and then mark the `RoomRecord` status as deleted. 
-  [ ] probably tweak how the version string in the worker path works, [currently only internal apis have versions](https://github.com/rocicorp/reflect-server/blob/1954e4e842b9b398003390b2c05493c03d9a3c15/src/server/dispatch.ts#L28). I'm inclined to add a version string to the externally accessible paths (eg, `/api/v1/create`) and remove the version string from the internal apis because  we never have different versions of room and auth dos trying to talk to each other. We deploy the room and auth do together, even in RaaS. Or i dunno, maybe just keep it @grgbkr ?
- [ ] integrate with replidraw-do and anything else using reflect-server
- [ ] update docs
- [ ] release
- [ ] get users to switch

---
List of things the customer is going to have to do (updating this list as we go):
- (probably) return the ""EU-only"" bit as part of UserData in the auth call
- make an explicit `createRoom` call from the client instead of relying on `connect` to create room implicitly
- handle new `connect` error case: the room is closed or deleted
- ack that the auth call covers both room creation and connection 
- (TBD how) run the room record migration once
- to delete a user's data, call `close` on the room, then `delete`

It already [does not wait for mutations to accumulate before sending them](https://github.com/rocicorp/reflect/blob/b12a12df9ea4ac511649eeff5eaeed1da42133ef/src/client/reflect.ts#L95), but that doesn't preclude multiple mutations from having landed by the time we actually crawl the memdag to get the pending mutations. For this issue we want to NOT [bundle all the mutations together into one push request](https://github.com/rocicorp/replicache-internal/blob/4cddcfdb1aeac8fac1b92b0d1fa9ecd6683462bc/src/sync/push.ts#L140) but instead `callPusher` on them individually. Unclear if we should keep using the PushRequest to wrap these mutations. On one hand it's there and works. On the other hand it's got unnecessary stuff in it.

More generally all the connection loop stuff that's in replicache might be doing us a disservice in reflect because reflect is just a different situation (eg, replicache protocol is stateless).

It came up because of routing.  I wanted to have validation of all routes happen mechanically, and we use zod everywhere else.

It's really trivial to switch from one of these to the other. They all have about the same API. And there's not really a cost to doing it, the cost is in implementing router support, not in annotating the call sites with one schema system or the other.

So I could just keep using superstruct as part of routing, that's easy, but it's also easy to choose a different one. I think it makes sense to make this choice as part of the routing work. 

For my part, from the benchmark Erik, there are a bunch that are way faster in ""assertion"" mode than parsing mode. We don't need parsing mode. The ""strict assertion"" mode would work fine for us. maybe we could even enable in production which would be amaze! Should we use one of those instead? Maybe since this a server and we dont' care about the size as much we should choose the fastest one as a starter. Like I said, since they all have equivalent APIs we could change it easy enough later.

~It came up because of routing, the reason I wanted to work on routing was to add validation.~

~I chose zod because we already have it everywhere else and have experience with it. The size concerns don't matter because it's on the server, and I believe perf has increased significantly since the benchmark erik points to.~

~I don't think there is a way to avoid sorting this out soonish, it's a piece of low-level infrastructure, not a nice-to-have. We need to report errors to users. If we don't have a system for this we will end up adding one-off error checking to every entrypoint and unit testing those. The work will be greater.~

The end result is to implement the not-implemented here: https://github.com/rocicorp/reflect-server/blob/main/src/storage/replicache-transaction.ts#L85

See https://github.com/rocicorp/replicache-express/blob/main/src/backend/replicache-transaction.ts#L73 for a working example in a different repo.

Some things to be careful implementing this:
1. The semantics of scan are that keys come out in a specific order (the order of the JavaScript sort() method). I am not sure if the built-in order of durable object's list() method are the same. (That's why the PR sorts, defensively)
2. The scan() method needs to scan over the union of pending changes and the stored data. We have a helper function in Replicache makeScanResult() that helps with this.
3. The scan() method is lazy (it's an async iterator), so it would be nice if we didn't read the entire keyspace into memory to implement this, but if the answer to (1) is unfavorable there might be no choice.
4. There are parameters to scan (startAt, endAt, limit) etc which could at least reduce the amount of data we read into memory from DO, but this fledgling PR doesn't use them.",U5JpbO_DuJsVSdksk839i

* As part of `[id].tsx` we read the instanceID from postgres and embed it in the page.
* When we construct Replicache we set the Replicache `schemaVersion` to `${instanceID}:${replicacheSchemaVersion}` (where $replicacheSchemaVersion is currently zero).

This is a bit confusing because there are two ""schemas"" floating around:

- The postgres schema, which is not (necessarily) visible to the client
- The replicache schema version, the schema of the data stored in Replicache

The two interact but are not the same thing.

This would work if the entire database (all spaces) is deleted. But do we want to handle the case where just one space is deleted? It seems like this mechanism should indeed handle it.

In that case you could put the ""instanceID"" in the space row instead of globally in the database. But now the question is: why not just the spaceID which we already have, and the problem there is that reloading the page wouldn't get you a new spaceID (nor would you want it to).

Also I kind of don't like this mechanism because it creates work for the developer. Now every app that cares about being able to delete server-side spaces has to have this mechanism to communicate the schema/instance to the client. It would be nicer to wrap this up into the Replicache protocol as https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/issues/91 proposes, but that is so much more work.",U5JpbO_DuJsVSdksk839i
m4nTB4R_SARoj1_nab3D3,R__ZJCDkMF5mjf-PCkQy4,1655860681000.0,"Actually I do not think `ServerStateNotFound` as described https://github.com/rocicorp/mono/issues/91 works. Here's why:

- Client A loads replicache-todo space S1
- Client A pushes first mutation which implicitly creates S1 (in replicache-todo)
- Client A pulls cookie 1 for space S1
- Now server state is deleted
- Client B loads replicache-todo space S1 (perhaps the URL was shared)
- Client B pushes first mutation which implicitly re-creates S1
- Now Client A pulls from cookie 1 for space S1
- Server returns nop patch, client A has wrong state.

Basically the ServerStateNotFound error tells a client that a particular server is not known, but because we share the server IDs among clients there is a chance the server can get recreated before a particular client pulls again and finds out it is deleted.

It seems like we have to ensure with these sample apps that use spaces that spaceIDs are not reused.",U5JpbO_DuJsVSdksk839i
leyVnPL5lgIEiThThh-aH,R__ZJCDkMF5mjf-PCkQy4,1655861500000.0,"OMG I think the solution is waaaaay easier than any of this. Problem is fundamentally that (a) by using an in-memory database we are basically deleting all the spaces, and (b) we implicitly create spaces on push if they don't exist.

(a) and (b) together mean that old clients that are referring to spaces created before a delete will recreate the space on the server, but find themselves in an incompatible state.

Easiest solution: stop doing (b). It doesn't reflect what real apps would do anyway -- documents aren't created implicitly by visiting a URL, they are created by tapping a ""create document"" button. We can create the space programmatically in https://github.com/rocicorp/replicache-todo/blob/main/pages/index.tsx before redirecting to it. Then we take out the code that implicitly creates in push. Then change push and pull to 500 if referring to a space that doesn't exist.

The effect will be:

- if you delete a replicache-todo database while a client is running, push and pull will both start failing because they refer to a space that no longer exists
- even if another client visits the `/d/<spaceid>` URL because it was shared, the space won't be recreated. The only way a space gets created is by visiting `/` and that creates a random new space, so spaces will never be reused.

I'm not aware of anyone using for anything except getting a single key or getting a contiguous set. Definitely those two use cases are overwhelmingly the most common from my observation.

We don't *need* to deprecate subscribe but we might want to if watch() can basically cover it as having both adds API complexity and bundle size (presumably?). Also if subscribe() can be implemented in terms of watch that's a good reason to move it out of the core.

> The callback to watch seems to imply a single diff operation.

Yeah good point. The callback should receive an array of diffOps so you can apply them all atomically to receivers. I think it wants to be a callback rather than a stream API because almost always people are going to hook this up to something like `useEffect()`. I feel like the async iterator would just create boilerplate.

rSi1P5dArCMHkWXCIy63W,uIPtGNKXCVYhL8r-XY8Ji,1654361877000.0,"Some of my own observations:

* Having `watch()` as a method of `ScanResult()` doesn't make sense after all because `ScanResult` is something that is scoped to a single transaction, whereas watch by definition spans transactions. So this seems to mean that watch should be a method of Replicache not of `ReadTransaction`, more similar to how `subscribe()` is today.
* It's common to want to monitor a single key for changes but this is less elegant in this API (have to `limit: 1`, and get first item from result).

Putting these two together I'm currently thinking something like:

```ts
rep.watchMany({prefix, startAt, limit})
    .filter(entry => ...)
    .sort((e1, e2) => ...)

rep.watch(id)
```

Open questions:

* Where does the callback go? With the API coming off `scan()` it was elegant to put it as the last method - `tx.scan().filter().sort().watch()`. Now that doesn't make sense.
  * Should the callback go in the `rep.watch()` method as a formal param or field of the options param? That's awkward to type with the chain after.
  * Or should we skip the chain and put `filter` and `sort` as optional fields on `WatchOptions`. That's less useful because you can't do multiple filters but maybe also less footgunny because you can't do silly things like have multiple sorts.
* It seems like ideally:
  * callback is last thing you type
  * should be possible to have zero or more filters
  * should be possible to have zero or one sorts
  * should be enforced that sort happens after filter
* The base use case is to receive through the callback a stream of arrays of diff ops. This would be used by e.g., solid, react+mobx (, and maybe svelte? need to investigate). But as a convenience for React and VanillaJS I think it would also be good to have `entries()`, `keys()`, `values()` that return an array of keys and/or values. The array should change identity each time there's a change, but the entries inside should only change identity when they change. This makes it easy to use with React and `memo()`. There's an argument here that maybe that should be in replicache-react, but it seems like something more generally useful.
* I feel like it would be useful to have `filter()` and `sort()` on `ReadTransaction.scan()` too. Could be a separate task but we should keep in mind we might go that direction.

Also I haven't thought this through at an impl level at all, there could very well be issues. This needs a design doc going into code-level design for sure.

# Overview

```ts
type WatchOptions = ScanOptions;

type Entry = {
  key: string;
  value: ReadonlyJSONValue;
};

type WatchChange = WatchInsert | WatchUpdate | WatchDelete;

type WatchInsert = {

  key: string;
  value: ReadonlyJSONValue;
};

type WatchUpdate = {
  type: ""update"";
  position: number;
  value: ReadonlyJSONValue;
};

type WatchDelete = {
  type: ""delete"";
  position: number;
};

// Call to cancel an existing watch
type CancelWatch = () => void;

class Replicache {
  ...
  watch(options: WatchOptions): FilterableWatchResult;

  // Just a convenience, really has nothing to do with watch(), can be implemented much more easily.
  watchOne(id: string, (entry: Entry|undefined) => void): CancelWatch;
  ...
}

interface WatchResult {
  // Fires every time one or more watched keys changes. Changes must be processed in order for positions
  // to make sense. All changes for a particular mutation are passed atomically to `changes()`. However,
  // multiple mutations may be reflected in same call to `changes()` (i.e., if one frame had many mutations).
  changes((changes: WatchChange[]) => void): CancelWatch;

  // Fires every time changes would, but passes an array of all current entries matching the watch.
  // The identity of the array does *not* change across calls, nor do the identities of unchanged values.
  // However the identity of changed values does change. This is intended to be used with e.g., React.memo().
  entries((entries: Entry[]) => void): CancelWatch;

  // Same as entries, but only returns the keys.
  keys((keys: string[]) => void): CancelWatch;

  // Same as entries, but only returns the values.
  values((values: ReadonlyJSONValue[]) => void): CancelWatch;
};

interface SortableWatchResult extends WatchResult {
  sort((e1: Entry, e2: Entry) => number): WatchResult;
};

interface FilterableWatchResult extends SortableWatchResult {
  filter((e: Entry) => boolean): FilterableWatchResult;
};
```

# First Result

When user first calls `watch()` their callback gets fired with a diff that is all `WatchInsert` representing the current state. If they call `entries()`, `keys()`, `values()`, their callback fires with an array matching current state.

If there are multiple open watches that need there first result (for example during page load) it is possible to collapse their watched key ranges and do only one iteration over the Replicache keyspace. Unclear whether this is a win, needs a test.

# Incremental Results

As the keyspace changes, Replicache checks changes against open watches. If they match, they are passed through the filter / sort chain incrementally, without re-scanning Replicache.

One option when designing the API is to realize that multiple filters can always be folded into one filter. And we only allow a single sort. Given that, maybe ""chaining"" isn't the way to go? Instead we could try an option bag:

I'm confused. The `Entry` type proposed here does include the key.

> I assume the position is all about updating an in memory array? I don't know if it is useful? If the filter changes the output array then the positions change. The only time I think the position can be useful is if there is no filter and no sort.

Right, the position represented in the callback would be adjusted. What's happening is that the output of a `watch()` is a list of key/value pairs sorted by some criteria (the `sort()` criteria). So the incremental updates have to be index-based, not key-based. Alternately you can think of it as outputting a set of splices. But since each change event will have arbitrary number of splices (because each transaction can touch arbitrary items) there doesn't seem to be any advantage to introducing a real splice concept and instead I just went with simpler delete(pos), insertAt(pos), update(pos).

You could actually get away with just delete and insertAt obvs. Maybe we should do that.

Put another way, the output of watch is a patch, but a patch to a list, not a patch to a dictionary.

> One option when designing the API is to realize that multiple filters can always be folded into one filter.

I thought about this, it just feels less ergonomic? If you feel strongly about it I'm OK limiting to one filter to start.

Some random thoughts

0. I think we want the DO (as in the single in-memory running instance).
The DO is critical to our whole design here -- it's the key bit. I don't
think SQLite changes that.
1. This embedded compute *sounds* like something we want, but I bet in
practice it is not. Because we are using the persistent storage more for
backup, not for complex calculations that need to run near to the db.
2. If we succeed in moving persistence more off the critical path then
SQLite becomes more viable!

This is a neat solution, ""neat"" as in ""clean"" or ""tidy"". To make sure I understand the implications (and cc @aboodman) I think having key sort order be according to code point means that:
- to compare keys on the server, if it has UTF-16 strings it must to use our comparison function and not whatever is native; and, if it does not have UTF-16 strings, it needs to do a bytewise comparison on the UTF8 encoding of the string (or some other equivalent way to sort by code point).
- locale-aware key sort order is not supported by Replicache. The code point sort order is what you get, even though it's not what is natural in non-english locales. So if you wanted to for example implement an in-order scannable dictionary in german you need to keep a secondary data structure with the appropriate order, or have a strategy to map from the actual key to a key with the right sort order.
- replicache doesn't do any kind of canonicalization; if this matters for the customer they need to do it before handing us a string.

Yes?

Second question: can you help me understand the advantage of the proposal above over the seemingly equivalent strategy of defining keys as UTF8 strings? Is it transcoding cost? If so it seems like most keys are generated by the server and will be received by the client as UTF8, so it seems like transcoding overhead from UTF16 to UTF8 might just be for strings that are created on the client. So, relatively small?

I talked with aaron a bit about this and he pointed out a couple of things:
1. we don't currently have a way to directly access the keys in the pull response as a UTF8 string or bytes. When we decode the response we get UTF16 strings, so we'd have to translate them back into UTF8 to do this. Presumably that is too costly. Or we could switch to a decoder that gave us direct access to the bytes while decoding, if such a thing exists.
2. it might be less convenient to browse keys in the web inspector. right now you can read them as strings and that is very useful. if they were displayed as bytes or similar that's a lot less useful.",ksbyih44eYKjA-Y3ms3v6

Another thing to remember is that the keys that gets passed into put, get, has, scan are all JS strings (utf16).

In the past when we used `Uint8Arrays` as keys we saw a lot of time being spent in `TextEncoder` and `TextDecoder`. Logically it should not be expensive to use these but these are not part of V8 and a lot of optimizations are not done.

Another thing to remember is that V8 (and other engines too) internally use ASCII strings whenever possible and this is the common case and these are very efficient.

I do not think it is worthwhile having byte arrays as keys for efficiency's sake. I think it would be worthwhile from a *usability/understandability* point of view. If we had byte string keys it would be super clear how to sort the keys on both client and server, there is no opportunity for using the wrong locale or sorting function, and there's no ""missing feature"" of having locale-aware key sorting (because nobody expects that of byte arrays).",ksbyih44eYKjA-Y3ms3v6

> If we had byte string keys it would be super clear how to sort the keys on both client and server, there is no opportunity for using the wrong locale or sorting function, and there's no ""missing feature"" of having locale-aware key sorting (because nobody expects that of byte arrays).

I agree but it's hard to implement with the rest of our system because:

1. The pull response is JSON. JSON doesn't have a byte array type for the keys. It would have to be some kind of encoded string.
2. Our target audience is JS developers. JS doesn't have good support for byte arrays.

It basically just very un-ergonomic to work with byte arrays in JavaScript. I think overall the simplicity/understandability is better if we say they are strings and specify the sort to be bytewise of utf-8 encoding.",U5JpbO_DuJsVSdksk839i

Anyway: With some space, I don't want to go overboard with the options for this silly little API.

I agree with Tom that it's typical in database systems to be able to say whether a foreign key permits nulls or not. If it permits nulls, then obviously there should be no message at all and just skip the row. If it does *not* permit nulls, then I agree with everyone who has said that ideally the transaction should not commit in the first place (i.e., the behavior should be `throw`, not `skip`). I don't know that there is any real use for the behavior `skip-and-log`, which is what we have now.

However, if we make the default `throw` now that would be a breaking change. So what I would like to propose is:

1. Add an `allowNull` flag to `CreateIndexOptions` which defaults to `false` which changes the behavior to silently allow nulls. This is a non-breaking change so can go out right away.
2. As a separate commit, change the default (`allowNull = false`) behavior to:
  - throw on null index values if `allowNull` is false (this is a breaking change)
  - put the better validation on json paths suggested in https://github.com/rocicorp/replicache/issues/913#issuecomment-1136730132 (also a breaking change)

We can do a point release from trunk after 1 is landed. Nothing else on trunk is a breaking change currently.

Separately, I think we should do:

3. Guard the changes from 2 behind a runtime flag. This would be good because it would mean that we could still do dot releases of 10.x after (2) has landed. We have never used this ""always shippable"" strategy before on Replicache, but it's common at Google, and we've talked about it being a good idea for Replicache in the past.

I think this is going to be hard to solve when none of us are online at the same time. Big picture I was trying to suggest separating out something simple that addressed user complaint from the ""right thing"".

Stepping back further nobody is even asking us for the current behavior of treating null/undefined fields as an error. The only reason we log when encountering null/undefined is because we only know how to index string, and I felt it was confusing to silently skip other types. But it's silly to keep trying to work around such a speculative feature. Let's just remove it.

I'm now in favor of just deleting the log line in the case the value is null/undefined on trunk and forgetting a `allowNull` or similar field entirely. The rest of this can be separate and might take awhile to asynchronously work through. Ingar could move onto other tasks in the meantime.

> Make path syntax errors early errors in createIndex

We agree. I was just trying to do this separate from this review since it's a breaking change.

> The current behavior is to abort indexing when an error occurs. It does not revert the keys and we end up with an incomplete index map 😢

That sounds like an existing problem not introduced by this PR? Can be addressed separately.

> If there is an error indexing we must not abort the mutation or pull.

I can see both sides of this. We do abort mutations and pulls for other reasons btw that are dev-controlled. So it's not breaking precedent. And you could say that if the user said allowEmpty=false it should be an exception to write such a value! That all said nobody is asking us to do anything if empty values are present so let's not drive ourselves crazy. We can just remove this error case until we have more information from users.

1. The first time I (and many) people use `createIndex` they get something about the syntax wrong. If the system doesn't complain loudly, it's hard to know whether it's working, what the problem is, etc. Silent failure for the default is a bad dx. If we change the log level to `debug` people won't see this output because people don't typically leave `debug` on.

2. But once people know the system and are seeing this message and don't want it, they can turn it off manually.

Theory is that CF logpush can help. But the other part of this story is that we need metrics around (re)starting so we are not relying on logging for this eg count of DO starts in a given period as well as some kind of rapid restart or flapping detection (a given roomDO quits and starts in rapid succession).

## Problems:

1. All existing runtime type validators are too slow to validate JSON. Especially large JSON structures that we have seen in the wild (i.e. Placemark)
2. Some validators clone the data at all times (i.e. zod)
3. Some validators have large code size and do not allow dead code elimination.
4. Some validators have bad error messages (i.e. superstruct)

## What I'm suggesting 

Use a validator that allows custom validation and use that for the JSON type. That way we can short circuit the runtime validation with our own that is much faster. We can even completely disable it in release mode.

After another stab at this I'm leaning towards [@badrap/valita](https://github.com/badrap/valita):
1. It has a way to do custom validation using `v.unknown().chain()` so we can use our own json validation function
2. Valita does not clone when doing `parse` (when `strict` or `passthrough` parsing)
3. Relatively small code size [bundlephobia](https://bundlephobia.com/package/@badrap/valita@0.2.0)
4. OK error messages. We can wrap these if we want",0Pa2nb7EDr1AfDVXIp8W3

3. Noam says that when the bug happens the symptom visible to source user is typically this client-side error message:

4. Noam captured client-side and server-side logs (at info level) from one of these sessions:
[logs.zip](https://github.com/rocicorp/reflect/files/8162834/logs.zip). The zip file also contains a heap profile but I'm not sure if that's from the same session. Noam not able to reproduce error at debug log level so far.

Thoughts scanning through these logs real quick... it looks like the ""client not found"" is the immediate cause. It does make sense that if a client wasn't found on server then symptom would be as Noam describes: mutations would pile up client side, drawing would appear to work, but when you refresh drawing not saved.

I do see the client-not-found error on server too. It appears this happens after two disconnect/reconnect cycles on client. Appears that somehow server state gets confused as to whether client is present.

1. I am able to successfully access Monday's datadog logs.   
2. I have not been able to reproduce the bug myself despite intensely scribbling for 4 mins (now my hand is tired :)).
3. I do see others hitting this ""client not found"" in the server log.  These clients are then wedged and try to keep pushing over the same web socket connection with the same client id, resulting in this same error over and over again.  I have not yet found the root cause for why the client is not found.  I have identified one change we should make that will prevent clients from becoming wedged when ""client not found"" occurs.  The connection should be closed by the server, as no messages over that connection will succeed.  Then the client can reconnect, and after reconnection should be unwedged.

I'm continuing to try to find the root cause of ""client not found"".

@aboodman where do you see the client get past the large push?  In my testing with your aa/stress-test branch, the client is behaving as expected.  After the large push fails and the connection is closed, the client reconnects, and on next mutation (you need a mutation to trigger the push) it will try to do the large push again.  One potential improvement is the client could auto retry the push (with backoffs and some cap on retries).

My guess is that the ""variance"" is a red herring. I bet that if we print
out the 50/75/90/95 percentiles we will see that it is actually pretty
stable now and that there is just 1 or 2 massive outliers (probably cold
start effects).

I think we should stop printing the variance and instead always print the
50/75/90/95 and then see how it is working. The variance is not that useful.

* There is an npm script in the Replicache package that generates a *license key* which encodes:
  - a unique account id
  - one or more host names
* The license key is signed by a private key known only to Rocicorp
* The license key and signature are provided as arguments to Replicache at startup
* Each time Replicache is constructed it validates the provided license key signature using Rocicorp's public key (embedded into Replicache) and also that the current host matches one of the allowed hosts
* If the license and usage is valid, Replicache pings a central server with:
  - The hash of the license key
  - The account ID from the license key
  - The client ID Replicache is instantiated in
  - (maybe?) the index of the host in the list of allowed hosts
 * The server records the ping associated with the account and client - the hash of the license key and ordinal of the host could be used for reporting UI for users later, though I admit it is kind of limited utility without mapping back to actual content of license
 * If the account is paid, or is free and within the free tier usage limits, then the ping returns OK. Otherwise it returns an error, and the client throws and does not work.
 * To upgrade from a free to paid account, customers email us and say hi, and we collect their credit card info over the phone, then mark their account paid in our server-side db so that pings return OK.

I do not think we should have this as a requirement, or at least we should not have this as a requirement right now. This feels like one of those requirements we ultimately did away with in DD like ""a snapshot should be useful without first having to hit disk"": sure, _ideally_ it's not possible to accidentally charge someone else's account, but practically speaking it doesn't seem worth the effort to implement such a mechanism at this point. We don't have this problem and adding the mechanism now constrains the way Replicache works in ways potentially annoying to customers (they go to use Replicache on some new thing and it doesn't work because domain).

I don't think we have to treat those two separate problems as one problem. I certainly agree that we should do something right now to prevent people from using the sample license key for something other than tire-kicking. However I don't think we need to prevent customers from using other customers keys right now. The first problem can be solved in a variety of simple ways that don't require elaborate mechanisms, for example if the sample key is used we can check in the client if the URL contains ""replidraw"", and if so then they are probably tire-kicking.
