-- Create the indices on upstream so we can copy to downstream on replication.
-- We have discussed that, in the future, the indices of the Zero replica
-- can / should diverge from the indices of the upstream. This is because
-- the Zero replica could be serving a different set of applications than the
-- upstream. If that is true, it would be beneficial to have indices dedicated
-- to those use cases. This may not be true, however.
--
-- Until then, I think it makes the most sense to copy the indices from upstream
-- to the replica. The argument in favor of this is that it gives the user a single
-- place to manage indices and it saves us a step in setting up our demo apps.
