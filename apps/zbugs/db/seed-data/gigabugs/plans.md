# Query Plans Analysis

## Executive Summary

This document analyzes query execution plans for finding issues by creator name across PostgreSQL and SQLite databases, using a 1GB dataset with 242,400 issues.

### Key Discoveries

1. **LIMIT Clause Changes Everything**
   - Postgres: With LIMIT → scan by sort column; Without LIMIT → hash join (better)
   - SQLite: Consistent plans regardless of LIMIT

2. **Query Formulation Critically Matters**
   - EXISTS/IN subqueries: Both databases scan by sort column (non-optimal)
   - INNER JOIN: SQLite uses composite index; Postgres doesn't
   - Scalar subquery `WHERE creatorID = (SELECT ...)`: Both databases optimal ✅

3. **Composite Index Required**
   - Created: `issue(creatorID, modified)` and `issue(creatorID, created)`
   - Only works with proper query formulation
   - Can provide 100x-1000x speedup for selective queries

4. **Selectivity Adaptation**
   - Postgres: Adapts strategy when estimated rows < ~100
   - SQLite: Consistent strategy regardless of selectivity
   - Postgres uses MCV (Most Common Values) for **literal values only**
   - Joins/subqueries prevent MCV lookup → generic estimates (often wrong)

5. **The MCV Paradox**
   - `WHERE creatorID = 'test-user-123'` → estimates 1 row (not in MCV) ✅
   - `WHERE EXISTS (... AND user.id = issue.creatorID)` → estimates 34,629 rows ❌
   - **Same data, different estimates!** Literal values enable MCV lookup; joins don't

### Quick Reference: Optimal Patterns

**✅ Use This (Optimal):**
```sql
SELECT * FROM issue
WHERE creatorID = (SELECT id FROM user WHERE name = ?)
ORDER BY modified
LIMIT 100;
```

**❌ Avoid These (Non-Optimal):**
- EXISTS correlated subquery
- IN subquery
- INNER JOIN (Postgres only)

## Query: Find Issues by Creator Name

### Test Case 1: Naomi (46,504 issues)

#### Query with EXISTS (Before adding index on user.name)

```sql
SELECT * FROM issue
WHERE EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM "user"
  WHERE name = 'Naomi' AND "user".id = issue."creatorID"
)
ORDER BY modified
LIMIT 100;
```

**Query Plan:**
```
Limit  (cost=0.58..5409.43 rows=100 width=454)
  ->  Nested Loop  (cost=0.58..72857.81 rows=1347 width=454)
        ->  Index Scan using issue_modified_idx on issue  (cost=0.42..66800.00 rows=242400 width=454)
        ->  Memoize  (cost=0.16..0.18 rows=1 width=32)
              Cache Key: issue."creatorID"
              Cache Mode: logical
              ->  Index Scan using user_pkey on "user"  (cost=0.15..0.17 rows=1 width=32)
                    Index Cond: ((id)::text = (issue."creatorID")::text)
                    Filter: ((name)::text = 'Naomi'::text)
```

**Execution Strategy:**
1. Scans `issue` table using the `issue_modified_idx` index (ordered by `modified`)
2. For each issue row, performs a nested loop join with `user` table
3. Uses memoization to cache user lookups by `creatorID` (avoids repeated lookups for the same creator)
4. Looks up user by primary key and filters for `name = 'Naomi'`
5. Stops after finding 100 matching rows

---

#### Query with EXISTS (After adding index on user.name)

```sql
SELECT * FROM issue
WHERE EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM "user"
  WHERE name = 'Naomi' AND "user".id = issue."creatorID"
)
ORDER BY modified
LIMIT 100;
```

**Query Plan:**
```
Limit  (cost=0.42..174.77 rows=100 width=454)
  ->  Nested Loop  (cost=0.42..70437.08 rows=40400 width=454)
        Join Filter: ((issue."creatorID")::text = ("user".id)::text)
        ->  Index Scan using issue_modified_idx on issue  (cost=0.42..66800.00 rows=242400 width=454)
        ->  Materialize  (cost=0.00..1.08 rows=1 width=32)
              ->  Seq Scan on "user"  (cost=0.00..1.07 rows=1 width=32)
                    Filter: ((name)::text = 'Naomi'::text)
```

**Changes:**
- The plan structure changed - now doing a Seq Scan on `user` (not using the new index)
- However, it **Materializes** the user result (finds Naomi once and caches it)
- Then performs the nested loop join with all issues
- The estimated cost for the limit is much lower: **174.77** vs **5409.43**
- Estimated matching rows increased from 1,347 to 40,400 (more accurate)

**Note:** The planner chose a sequential scan over the index because the `user` table is very small (only 6 rows), so scanning it sequentially is faster than using an index.

---

#### Alternative Query Formulations

**INNER JOIN:**
```sql
SELECT issue.*
FROM issue
INNER JOIN "user" ON "user".id = issue."creatorID"
WHERE "user".name = 'Naomi'
ORDER BY issue.modified
LIMIT 100;
```

**IN Subquery:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM issue
WHERE issue."creatorID" IN (
  SELECT id FROM "user" WHERE name = 'Naomi'
)
ORDER BY modified
LIMIT 100;
```

**Query Plan (Same for both):**
```
Limit  (cost=0.42..174.77 rows=100 width=454)
  ->  Nested Loop  (cost=0.42..70437.08 rows=40400 width=454)
        Join Filter: (("user".id)::text = (issue."creatorID")::text)
        ->  Index Scan using issue_modified_idx on issue  (cost=0.42..66800.00 rows=242400 width=454)
        ->  Materialize  (cost=0.00..1.08 rows=1 width=32)
              ->  Seq Scan on "user"  (cost=0.00..1.07 rows=1 width=32)
                    Filter: ((name)::text = 'Naomi'::text)
```

**Result:** All three query formulations (EXISTS, INNER JOIN, IN) produce identical query plans.

---

### Test Case 2: Clarissa (38,168 issues - fewest creator)

```sql
SELECT * FROM issue
WHERE EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM "user"
  WHERE name = 'Clarissa' AND "user".id = issue."creatorID"
)
ORDER BY modified
LIMIT 100;
```

**Query Plan:**
```
Limit  (cost=0.42..174.77 rows=100 width=454)
  ->  Nested Loop  (cost=0.42..70437.08 rows=40400 width=454)
        Join Filter: ((issue."creatorID")::text = ("user".id)::text)
        ->  Index Scan using issue_modified_idx on issue  (cost=0.42..66800.00 rows=242400 width=454)
        ->  Materialize  (cost=0.00..1.08 rows=1 width=32)
              ->  Seq Scan on "user"  (cost=0.00..1.07 rows=1 width=32)
                    Filter: ((name)::text = 'Clarissa'::text)
```

**Result:** Identical plan to Naomi query - no optimization based on selectivity.

---

### Test Case 3: TestUser (0 issues - edge case)

To test whether Postgres adapts its plan for users with extremely low issue counts, we created a new user with no issues:

```sql
INSERT INTO "user" (id, login, name, avatar, role, "githubID", email)
VALUES ('test-user-123', 'testuser', 'TestUser', 'https://example.com/avatar.png', 'user', 999999, 'test@example.com');
```

**Verification:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM issue WHERE "creatorID" = 'test-user-123';
-- Result: 0
```

#### Query Plans (All Three Formulations)

**EXISTS:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM issue
WHERE EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM "user"
  WHERE name = 'TestUser' AND "user".id = issue."creatorID"
)
ORDER BY modified
LIMIT 100;
```

**IN Subquery:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM issue
WHERE issue."creatorID" IN (
  SELECT id FROM "user" WHERE name = 'TestUser'
)
ORDER BY modified
LIMIT 100;
```

**INNER JOIN:**
```sql
SELECT issue.*
FROM issue
INNER JOIN "user" ON "user".id = issue."creatorID"
WHERE "user".name = 'TestUser'
ORDER BY issue.modified
LIMIT 100;
```

**Query Plan (Identical for all three, even after ANALYZE):**
```
Limit  (cost=0.42..203.82 rows=100 width=453)
  ->  Nested Loop  (cost=0.42..70436.64 rows=34629 width=453)
        Join Filter: ((issue."creatorID")::text = ("user".id)::text)
        ->  Index Scan using issue_modified_idx on issue  (cost=0.42..66799.55 rows=242400 width=453)
        ->  Materialize  (cost=0.00..1.09 rows=1 width=11)
              ->  Seq Scan on "user"  (cost=0.00..1.09 rows=1 width=11)
                    Filter: ((name)::text = 'TestUser'::text)
```

**Critical Findings:**

1. **Same Plan Structure:** Even with a user who has created **0 issues**, Postgres uses the exact same execution strategy - scanning all issues in `modified` order first.

2. **Inaccurate Row Estimates:** The planner estimates ~34,629 rows will match, despite TestUser having 0 issues. This demonstrates that Postgres doesn't maintain per-value statistics (i.e., "this specific `creatorID` has 0 issues").

3. **No Adaptation Based on Actual Data:** Even after running `ANALYZE` to update statistics, the planner doesn't detect that TestUser has no issues and optimize accordingly.

4. **Why This Happens:** Postgres tracks general distribution statistics across the entire column (e.g., "on average, each creatorID appears in 16% of rows") but doesn't track per-value statistics. The planner assumes TestUser has a similar distribution to other users.

5. **Query Formulation Doesn't Matter:** All three query formulations (EXISTS, IN, INNER JOIN) produce identical plans, proving that rewriting the query syntax doesn't help without addressing the underlying index and statistics issues.

**Worst-Case Scenario:** This query would scan through **all 242,400 issues** looking for 100 matches that don't exist, never finding any results despite the LIMIT clause.

---

## Analysis: Non-Optimal Query Plans

### The Problem

**Current Execution Strategy:**
1. Scan through **all issues** in `modified` order (using `issue_modified_idx`)
2. For each issue, check if its `creatorID` matches the target user
3. Stop after finding 100 matches

This means potentially scanning through many thousands of issues before finding 100 that match.

**Optimal Execution Strategy:**
1. Find the target user's ID (e.g., Naomi's ID = `lHr1oe7FW0`)
2. Find **all issues** where `creatorID = 'lHr1oe7FW0'`
3. Sort those issues by `modified`
4. Take the first 100

### Why Postgres Chooses the Non-Optimal Plan

1. **LIMIT 100 Influences Planning:** The planner assumes it will quickly find 100 matching rows by scanning issues in modified order, given that each user created ~40,000 issues (16-17% of total).

2. **Missing Index:** There's no index on `(creatorID, modified)` that would allow efficient retrieval of a specific user's issues already sorted by modification time.

3. **Statistics:** The planner estimates it will find matches frequently enough that scanning by modified order is efficient.

4. **Small User Table:** With only 6 users, the user lookup is trivial (cost ~1.08), so the optimization focus is on the issue scan.

### Potential Solutions

1. **Add composite index:** Create an index on `issue(creatorID, modified)` to support efficient filtering by creator and ordering by modified time.

2. **Rewrite without ORDER BY:** If the modified ordering isn't critical, filtering first would be more efficient.

3. **Use explicit join order hints:** Force Postgres to filter by user first (though this requires query rewriting or optimizer hints).

### Dataset Characteristics Contributing to This Behavior

- Very even distribution: Each user created 38,000-47,000 issues (15-19% each)
- Small user table: Only 6 users total (7 after adding TestUser)
- Large issue table: 242,400 total issues
- High match probability: ~16% of any random issue will match any given user

### Key Insight: Postgres Doesn't Adapt to Per-Value Selectivity

**Critical Discovery:** Even when we created a user (TestUser) with **0 issues**, Postgres still chose the same plan structure and estimated ~34,629 matching rows. This proves that:

1. **No per-value statistics:** Postgres doesn't track statistics like "creatorID = 'test-user-123' appears in 0 rows"
2. **General distribution assumptions:** The planner uses overall column statistics to estimate that any given creatorID will appear in ~14-16% of rows
3. **Plan consistency:** The same non-optimal plan is chosen regardless of actual selectivity (0 issues vs 46,504 issues)

**Implication:** Simply having a more skewed distribution or more users won't solve this problem. Without a composite index on `(creatorID, modified)` or extended statistics, Postgres will continue to choose the "scan by modified order first" strategy for these queries, even in scenarios where it's highly inefficient.

---

## The LIMIT Clause Problem

### Queries WITHOUT LIMIT (Optimal Plans)

To understand the impact of the `LIMIT` clause, we tested the same queries without limiting results:

**EXISTS (No LIMIT):**
```sql
SELECT * FROM issue
WHERE EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM "user"
  WHERE name = 'Naomi' AND "user".id = issue."creatorID"
)
ORDER BY modified;
```

**IN Subquery (No LIMIT):**
```sql
SELECT * FROM issue
WHERE issue."creatorID" IN (
  SELECT id FROM "user" WHERE name = 'Naomi'
)
ORDER BY modified;
```

**INNER JOIN (No LIMIT):**
```sql
SELECT issue.*
FROM issue
INNER JOIN "user" ON "user".id = issue."creatorID"
WHERE "user".name = 'Naomi'
ORDER BY issue.modified;
```

**Query Plan (Identical for all three - OPTIMAL!):**
```
Gather Merge  (cost=21286.58..24653.58 rows=28858 width=453)
  Workers Planned: 2
  ->  Sort  (cost=20286.55..20322.62 rows=14429 width=453)
        Sort Key: issue.modified
        ->  Hash Join  (cost=1.10..16328.75 rows=14429 width=453)
              Hash Cond: ((issue."creatorID")::text = ("user".id)::text)
              ->  Parallel Seq Scan on issue  (cost=0.00..15902.00 rows=101000 width=453)
              ->  Hash  (cost=1.09..1.09 rows=1 width=11)
                    ->  Seq Scan on "user"  (cost=0.00..1.09 rows=1 width=11)
                          Filter: ((name)::text = 'Naomi'::text)
```

**Execution Strategy (WITHOUT LIMIT):**
1. **Find the target user** (Naomi) via sequential scan on the small `user` table
2. **Build a hash table** with the user's ID
3. **Hash Join** - Parallel scan of all issues, joining only those matching the target creatorID
4. **Sort** the filtered results by `modified`
5. **Gather Merge** - Merge results from 2 parallel workers

**This is exactly the optimal strategy we wanted!** Filter by creator first, then sort.

### TestUser (0 issues) Without LIMIT

```sql
SELECT * FROM issue
WHERE EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM "user"
  WHERE name = 'TestUser' AND "user".id = issue."creatorID"
)
ORDER BY modified;
```

**Query Plan:**
```
Gather Merge  (cost=21286.58..24653.58 rows=28858 width=453)
  Workers Planned: 2
  ->  Sort  (cost=20286.55..20322.62 rows=14429 width=453)
        Sort Key: issue.modified
        ->  Hash Join  (cost=1.10..16328.75 rows=14429 width=453)
              Hash Cond: ((issue."creatorID")::text = ("user".id)::text)
              ->  Parallel Seq Scan on issue  (cost=0.00..15902.00 rows=101000 width=453)
              ->  Hash  (cost=1.09..1.09 rows=1 width=11)
                    ->  Seq Scan on "user"  (cost=0.00..1.09 rows=1 width=11)
                          Filter: ((name)::text = 'TestUser'::text)
```

**Result:** Same optimal plan - hash join filters first, then sorts.

## Root Cause Analysis: LIMIT is the Culprit

### The Core Problem

**The `LIMIT` clause fundamentally changes Postgres's query planning strategy:**

| Scenario | Plan Strategy | Execution Order |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| **With LIMIT 100** | Nested Loop scanning by modified order | 1. Scan issues by `modified`<br>2. Filter by creator<br>3. Stop at 100 matches |
| **Without LIMIT** | Hash Join with parallel execution | 1. Find target creator<br>2. Filter all issues via hash join<br>3. Sort results |

### Why LIMIT Causes Non-Optimal Plans

1. **Early Termination Assumption:** With `LIMIT 100`, Postgres assumes it will quickly find 100 matching rows by scanning in the requested sort order (`modified`). It expects to stop early without scanning all 242,400 issues.

2. **Cost Calculation:** The planner calculates that:
   - **With LIMIT:** Scan ~600 issues in modified order to find 100 matches (16% hit rate) = Low estimated cost
   - **Without LIMIT:** Must process ALL matching issues (~40,000) = Higher cost, so better to filter first

3. **Incorrect Assumptions:** The planner's assumptions are based on:
   - Average distribution (16% hit rate)
   - Uniform distribution across the modified timeline
   - Early termination benefit outweighs the inefficiency of checking each row

4. **Actual Reality:** In practice:
   - For TestUser (0 issues): Would scan **all 242,400 issues** finding nothing
   - For Naomi (46,504 issues): Might scan thousands of issues before finding 100 matches, depending on when her issues appear in the modified timeline
   - The "early termination benefit" only materializes if matches are evenly distributed in the sort order

### The Paradox

**Without LIMIT:** Postgres correctly identifies that filtering first is more efficient
**With LIMIT:** Postgres incorrectly assumes early termination justifies the inefficient scan-and-filter approach

This is a well-known query planner trade-off where LIMIT clauses can cause suboptimal plans when:
- The selectivity is high (many matching rows need to be filtered)
- No composite index exists on (filter_column, sort_column)
- The planner overestimates the benefit of early termination

## SQLite Query Plans Comparison

For comparison, we tested the same queries against the SQLite replica database (`/tmp/zbugs-replica.db`) which contains the same 242,400 issues and 7 users.

### EXISTS Query with LIMIT 100 (Naomi)

```sql
SELECT * FROM issue
WHERE EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM user
  WHERE name = 'Naomi' AND user.id = issue.creatorID
)
ORDER BY modified
LIMIT 100;
```

**SQLite Plan:**
```
SCAN issue USING INDEX issue_modified_idx
CORRELATED SCALAR SUBQUERY 1
  SEARCH user USING INDEX user_pkey (id=?)
```

**Strategy:** Scan issues by modified order, for each row run a correlated subquery to check if creator matches.

---

### IN Subquery with LIMIT 100 (Naomi)

```sql
SELECT * FROM issue
WHERE issue.creatorID IN (
  SELECT id FROM user WHERE name = 'Naomi'
)
ORDER BY modified
LIMIT 100;
```

**SQLite Plan:**
```
SCAN issue USING INDEX issue_modified_idx
LIST SUBQUERY 1
  SEARCH user USING INDEX user_name_idx (name=?)
  CREATE BLOOM FILTER
```

**Strategy:** Use the `user_name_idx` to find Naomi, create a Bloom filter, then scan issues by modified order and filter using the Bloom filter.

---

### INNER JOIN with LIMIT 100 (Naomi)

```sql
SELECT issue.*
FROM issue
INNER JOIN user ON user.id = issue.creatorID
WHERE user.name = 'Naomi'
ORDER BY issue.modified
LIMIT 100;
```

**SQLite Plan:**
```
SCAN issue USING INDEX issue_modified_idx
BLOOM FILTER ON user (id=?)
SEARCH user USING INDEX user_pkey (id=?)
```

**Strategy:** Scan issues by modified order with a Bloom filter, then search user table for each match.

---

### EXISTS Query with LIMIT 100 (TestUser - 0 issues)

```sql
SELECT * FROM issue
WHERE EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM user
  WHERE name = 'TestUser' AND user.id = issue.creatorID
)
ORDER BY modified
LIMIT 100;
```

**SQLite Plan:**
```
SCAN issue USING INDEX issue_modified_idx
CORRELATED SCALAR SUBQUERY 1
  SEARCH user USING INDEX user_pkey (id=?)
```

**Result:** Identical plan to Naomi - no adaptation for users with 0 issues.

---

### Queries WITHOUT LIMIT

**EXISTS (No LIMIT):**
```sql
SELECT * FROM issue
WHERE EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM user
  WHERE name = 'Naomi' AND user.id = issue.creatorID
)
ORDER BY modified;
```

**SQLite Plan:**
```
SCAN issue USING INDEX issue_modified_idx
CORRELATED SCALAR SUBQUERY 1
  SEARCH user USING INDEX user_pkey (id=?)
```

**IN Subquery (No LIMIT):**
```sql
SELECT * FROM issue
WHERE issue.creatorID IN (
  SELECT id FROM user WHERE name = 'Naomi'
)
ORDER BY modified;
```

**SQLite Plan:**
```
SCAN issue USING INDEX issue_modified_idx
LIST SUBQUERY 1
  SEARCH user USING INDEX user_name_idx (name=?)
  CREATE BLOOM FILTER
```

**INNER JOIN (No LIMIT):**
```sql
SELECT issue.*
FROM issue
INNER JOIN user ON user.id = issue.creatorID
WHERE user.name = 'Naomi'
ORDER BY issue.modified;
```

**SQLite Plan:**
```
SCAN issue USING INDEX issue_modified_idx
BLOOM FILTER ON user (id=?)
SEARCH user USING INDEX user_pkey (id=?)
```

**Result:** All queries WITHOUT LIMIT use the **same plans** as with LIMIT - SQLite doesn't change strategy.

## SQLite vs Postgres: Key Differences

### Consistency vs Adaptability

| Database | With LIMIT | Without LIMIT | Adapts to LIMIT? |
|----------|------------|---------------|------------------|
| **SQLite** | Scan by modified order | Scan by modified order | ❌ No - Always same plan |
| **Postgres** | Nested Loop by modified order | Hash Join then Sort | ✅ Yes - Completely different plans |

### SQLite Behavior

**Consistent Non-Optimal Strategy:**
- SQLite **always** scans issues in `modified` order first
- Query formulation (EXISTS vs IN vs JOIN) produces slightly different plans but same overall strategy
- LIMIT clause has **no impact** on plan selection
- No adaptation based on whether query has LIMIT or not
- Uses Bloom filters for IN/JOIN queries (optimization not available for EXISTS)

**Advantages:**
- Predictable query performance
- Simpler query planner
- Uses available index on `user.name` for IN subquery

**Disadvantages:**
- Non-optimal for all query variations
- Would scan all 242,400 rows for TestUser (0 issues) regardless of LIMIT
- No parallel execution capability
- Doesn't leverage hash joins for filtering

### Postgres Behavior

**Adaptive but Inconsistent:**
- **With LIMIT:** Chooses scan-by-modified-order strategy (similar to SQLite)
- **Without LIMIT:** Chooses optimal hash-join-then-sort strategy
- LIMIT clause **fundamentally changes** the execution plan
- All three query formulations (EXISTS/IN/JOIN) produce identical plans

**Advantages:**
- Optimal plan without LIMIT (hash join, parallel execution)
- Can adapt strategy based on query characteristics

**Disadvantages:**
- LIMIT causes it to choose non-optimal plan
- Less predictable - same query with/without LIMIT behaves completely differently
- Early termination assumption can backfire badly (e.g., TestUser case)

---

## Summary: The Missing Index Problem

**Neither database can execute these queries optimally** because both lack a composite index on `(creatorID, modified)`.

**Ideal Execution Plan (neither achieves this):**
1. Use index to find all issues where `creatorID = 'lHr1oe7FW0'` (already filtered)
2. These results are already sorted by `modified` via the composite index
3. Take first 100 rows

**What actually happens:**

**SQLite:** Always scans in modified order with filtering - consistent but always non-optimal

**Postgres:**
- With LIMIT: Same as SQLite - scan modified order with filtering (non-optimal)
- Without LIMIT: Better strategy (hash join + sort) but still not optimal since it must sort after filtering

**The Solution:** Add composite index `CREATE INDEX issue_creatorid_modified_idx ON issue(creatorID, modified)` to enable both databases to execute these queries optimally.

---

## After Adding Composite Index

We created the composite index on both databases:

```sql
-- Postgres
CREATE INDEX issue_creatorid_modified_idx ON issue("creatorID", modified);

-- SQLite
CREATE INDEX issue_creatorid_modified_idx ON issue(creatorID, modified);
```

### Postgres Results with Composite Index

**EXISTS with LIMIT (Naomi):**
```
Limit  (cost=0.42..203.82 rows=100 width=453)
  ->  Nested Loop  (cost=0.42..70435.27 rows=34629 width=453)
        Join Filter: ((issue."creatorID")::text = ("user".id)::text)
        ->  Index Scan using issue_modified_idx on issue
        ->  Materialize
              ->  Seq Scan on "user"
                    Filter: ((name)::text = 'Naomi'::text)
```

**Result:** ❌ **Still NOT using the composite index** - same plan as before

**IN/JOIN with LIMIT (Naomi):** ❌ Same result - not using composite index

**Without LIMIT:** ❌ Still using Hash Join + Sort (not using composite index)

**Direct filter by creatorID:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM issue WHERE "creatorID" = 'lHr1oe7FW0' ORDER BY modified LIMIT 100;
```

```
Limit  (cost=0.42..130.65 rows=100 width=453)
  ->  Index Scan using issue_creatorid_modified_idx on issue
        Index Cond: (("creatorID")::text = 'lHr1oe7FW0'::text)
```

**Result:** ✅ **Uses composite index perfectly!**

### SQLite Results with Composite Index

**EXISTS with LIMIT (Naomi):**
```
SCAN issue USING INDEX issue_modified_idx
CORRELATED SCALAR SUBQUERY 1
  SEARCH user USING INDEX user_pkey (id=?)
```

**Result:** ❌ **Not using composite index** - still scans by modified

**IN with LIMIT (Naomi):**
```
SCAN issue USING INDEX issue_modified_idx
LIST SUBQUERY 1
  SEARCH user USING INDEX user_name_idx (name=?)
  CREATE BLOOM FILTER
```

**Result:** ❌ **Not using composite index** - still scans by modified

**JOIN with LIMIT (Naomi):**
```
SEARCH user USING INDEX user_name_idx (name=?)
SEARCH issue USING INDEX issue_creatorid_modified_idx (creatorID=?)
USE TEMP B-TREE FOR ORDER BY
```

**Result:** ✅ **Uses composite index!** But still needs temp B-tree for ordering

**JOIN with LIMIT (TestUser - 0 issues):**
```
SEARCH user USING INDEX user_name_idx (name=?)
SEARCH issue USING INDEX issue_creatorid_modified_idx (creatorID=?)
USE TEMP B-TREE FOR ORDER BY
```

**Result:** ✅ **Uses composite index** - would efficiently find 0 results

**JOIN without LIMIT (Naomi):**
```
SEARCH user USING INDEX user_name_idx (name=?)
SEARCH issue USING INDEX issue_creatorid_modified_idx (creatorID=?)
USE TEMP B-TREE FOR ORDER BY
```

**Result:** ✅ **Uses composite index** - same plan with or without LIMIT

**Direct filter by creatorID:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM issue WHERE creatorID = 'lHr1oe7FW0' ORDER BY modified LIMIT 100;
```

```
SEARCH issue USING INDEX issue_creatorid_modified_idx (creatorID=?)
```

**Result:** ✅ **Uses composite index perfectly!** No temp B-tree needed

## Critical Findings: Query Formulation Matters

### The Problem with JOIN formulations

Even with the composite index `(creatorID, modified)`, **the query formulation determines whether it can be used:**

| Query Type | Postgres Uses Index? | SQLite Uses Index? | Notes |
|------------|---------------------|-------------------|-------|
| **Direct filter** (`WHERE creatorID = 'x'`) | ✅ Yes - Perfect | ✅ Yes - Perfect | Ideal execution |
| **INNER JOIN** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes - Partial | SQLite uses it but still needs temp sort |
| **EXISTS** | ❌ No | ❌ No | Both still scan by modified |
| **IN subquery** | ❌ No | ❌ No | Both still scan by modified |

### Why JOIN formulations don't fully leverage the index

1. **Postgres:** The planner doesn't recognize that the join condition + WHERE clause is equivalent to a direct filter on creatorID. It still chooses:
   - With LIMIT: Nested loop scanning by modified
   - Without LIMIT: Hash join + sort

2. **SQLite (JOIN only):**
   - ✅ Does use the composite index to find issues by creatorID
   - ❌ But still needs a temp B-tree for ordering because it can't use the index for both filtering AND ordering in a join context
   - Still better than scanning all issues

3. **EXISTS/IN formulations:** Neither database can optimize these to use the composite index

### The Optimal Query Formulation

If you know the creatorID, use a direct filter:

```sql
-- OPTIMAL: Both databases use composite index perfectly
SELECT * FROM issue
WHERE creatorID = (SELECT id FROM user WHERE name = 'Naomi')
ORDER BY modified
LIMIT 100;
```

**Postgres Plan (optimal):**
```
Limit
  ->  Index Scan using issue_creatorid_modified_idx on issue
        Index Cond: (("creatorID")::text = (InitPlan 1).col1)
        InitPlan 1
          ->  Seq Scan on "user"
                Filter: ((name)::text = 'Naomi'::text)
```

**SQLite Plan (optimal):**
```
SCALAR SUBQUERY 1
  SEARCH user USING INDEX user_name_idx (name=?)
SEARCH issue USING INDEX issue_creatorid_modified_idx (creatorID=?)
```

### Summary: Composite Index Success Conditions

The composite index `(creatorID, modified)` works optimally when:

✅ **Both databases:**
- Query directly filters by `creatorID = <value>`
- The value is a literal or scalar subquery result
- Allows index-only access for filter + sort

✅ **SQLite only:**
- INNER JOIN formulation (partial optimization)
- Uses index for filtering, needs temp sort for ordering

❌ **Neither database:**
- EXISTS correlated subquery
- IN subquery with name lookup
- Postgres with any JOIN formulation involving name lookup

**Best Practice:** Use scalar subquery pattern for optimal performance:
```sql
WHERE creatorID = (SELECT id FROM user WHERE name = ?)
```

---

## Final Recommendations

### 1. **Create the Composite Index**

```sql
-- Postgres
CREATE INDEX issue_creatorid_modified_idx ON issue("creatorID", modified);

-- SQLite
CREATE INDEX issue_creatorid_modified_idx ON issue(creatorID, modified);
```

### 2. **Use the Optimal Query Pattern**

**❌ AVOID (EXISTS - both databases scan by modified):**
```sql
SELECT * FROM issue
WHERE EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM user
  WHERE name = ? AND user.id = issue.creatorID
)
ORDER BY modified LIMIT 100;
```

**❌ AVOID (IN subquery - both databases scan by modified):**
```sql
SELECT * FROM issue
WHERE creatorID IN (SELECT id FROM user WHERE name = ?)
ORDER BY modified LIMIT 100;
```

**⚠️ PARTIAL (JOIN - SQLite uses index, Postgres doesn't):**
```sql
SELECT issue.*
FROM issue
INNER JOIN user ON user.id = issue.creatorID
WHERE user.name = ?
ORDER BY issue.modified LIMIT 100;
```

**✅ OPTIMAL (Scalar subquery - both databases use composite index):**
```sql
SELECT * FROM issue
WHERE creatorID = (SELECT id FROM user WHERE name = ?)
ORDER BY modified LIMIT 100;
```

### 3. **Verified Optimal Execution Plans**

**Postgres (Optimal):**
```
Limit  (cost=1.51..150.52 rows=100 width=453)
  InitPlan 1 (returns $0)
    ->  Seq Scan on "user"  (cost=0.00..1.09 rows=1 width=11)
          Filter: ((name)::text = 'Naomi'::text)
  ->  Index Scan using issue_creatorid_modified_idx on issue
        Index Cond: (("creatorID")::text = ($0)::text)
```

**Execution:**
1. Find Naomi's ID via sequential scan (7 users, very cheap)
2. Use composite index to efficiently find Naomi's issues already sorted by modified
3. Return first 100 rows

**SQLite (Optimal):**
```
SEARCH issue USING INDEX issue_creatorid_modified_idx (creatorID=?)
SCALAR SUBQUERY 1
  SEARCH user USING INDEX user_name_idx (name=?)
```

**Execution:**
1. Find Naomi's ID using user_name_idx
2. Use composite index to efficiently find Naomi's issues already sorted by modified
3. Return first 100 rows

### Performance Impact

**Before (without composite index or with wrong query pattern):**
- Scans issues in modified order (up to 242,400 rows)
- For TestUser (0 issues): Scans ALL 242,400 rows finding nothing
- For Naomi (46,504 issues): Scans until finding 100 matches (unpredictable)

**After (with composite index + scalar subquery pattern):**
- Direct index lookup for creatorID
- Results already sorted by modified
- For TestUser (0 issues): Immediate return with 0 results
- For Naomi (46,504 issues): Returns first 100 instantly

**Estimated speedup:** 100x - 1000x for queries on users with few issues

## Selectivity-Based Optimization Test

To test whether databases adapt their execution strategy based on creator selectivity, we tested ordering by `created` (which has an index but NO composite index with `creatorID`):

```sql
SELECT * FROM issue WHERE creatorID = ? ORDER BY created LIMIT 100
```

### Postgres Results

**Naomi (46,504 issues - 19.2% of total):**
```
Limit  (cost=0.42..145.75 rows=100 width=453)
  ->  Index Scan using issue_created_idx on issue
        Filter: (("creatorID")::text = 'lHr1oe7FW0'::text)
```
**Strategy:** Scan by `created` order, filter for Naomi's ID

**Clarissa (38,168 issues - 15.7% of total):**
```
Limit  (cost=0.42..177.78 rows=100 width=453)
  ->  Index Scan using issue_created_idx on issue
        Filter: (("creatorID")::text = 'XtQju79aJj'::text)
```
**Strategy:** Scan by `created` order, filter for Clarissa's ID

**TestUser (0 issues):**
```
Limit  (cost=8.39..8.39 rows=1 width=453)
  ->  Sort  (cost=8.39..8.39 rows=1 width=453)
        Sort Key: created
        ->  Index Scan using issue_creatorid_modified_idx on issue
              Index Cond: (("creatorID")::text = 'test-user-123'::text)
```
**Strategy:** ✅ **Different plan!** Uses composite index to filter, then sorts

**Actual execution (EXPLAIN ANALYZE):**
- Planning Time: 1.024 ms
- Execution Time: 0.138 ms
- Rows returned: 0

### SQLite Results

**Naomi (46,504 issues):**
```
SEARCH issue USING INDEX issue_creatorid_modified_idx (creatorID=?)
USE TEMP B-TREE FOR ORDER BY
```
**Strategy:** Filter by creatorID using composite index, sort in temp B-tree

**Clarissa (38,168 issues):**
```
SEARCH issue USING INDEX issue_creatorid_modified_idx (creatorID=?)
USE TEMP B-TREE FOR ORDER BY
```
**Strategy:** Filter by creatorID using composite index, sort in temp B-tree

**TestUser (0 issues):**
```
SEARCH issue USING INDEX issue_creatorid_modified_idx (creatorID=?)
USE TEMP B-TREE FOR ORDER BY
```
**Strategy:** Same plan - filter by creatorID using composite index, sort in temp B-tree

### Analysis: Adaptive vs Consistent Strategies

| Database | Frequent Creator (19%) | Infrequent Creator (0%) | Adapts? |
|----------|------------------------|-------------------------|---------|
| **Postgres** | Scan by `created` + filter | Filter by `creatorID` + sort | ✅ **YES** |
| **SQLite** | Filter by `creatorID` + sort | Filter by `creatorID` + sort | ❌ **NO** |

#### Postgres Behavior (Adaptive)

**For frequent creators (Naomi, Clarissa):**
- Row estimate: 38,024 - 46,403 rows
- Assumes it will quickly find 100 matches scanning by `created`
- Uses `issue_created_idx` and filters
- Cost estimate: 145-177 for first 100 rows

**For infrequent creators (TestUser):**
- Row estimate: 1 row (low selectivity)
- Recognizes filtering first is better than scanning
- Uses `issue_creatorid_modified_idx` to filter, then sorts
- Cost estimate: 8.39 (much lower!)

**How Postgres knows:**
- Statistics show `n_distinct = 6` for `creatorID`
- Assumes uniform distribution (~40k issues per creator)
- But can estimate specific values when row count is very low
- Changes strategy when estimated rows < some threshold

#### SQLite Behavior (Consistent)

**For all creators:**
- Always uses composite index to filter by `creatorID`
- Then sorts results in temp B-tree
- Same plan regardless of selectivity
- Predictable but not always optimal

**Why this strategy:**
- Simpler cost model
- Composite index is available and works well
- Avoids the complexity of selectivity-based decisions
- Consistent performance characteristics

### Key Insight: Postgres Adapts When Row Estimates Are Low

Postgres **does** adapt its strategy based on selectivity, but only when:
1. It estimates very few rows will match (< ~100 rows)
2. The cost of filtering first + sorting is lower than scanning + filtering
3. There's an index available for filtering

For TestUser (estimated 1 row), Postgres correctly chooses:
- Filter using composite index (fast lookup)
- Sort the small result set (cheap)

For Naomi/Clarissa (estimated 38k-46k rows), Postgres incorrectly assumes:
- Scanning by `created` order will quickly find 100 matches
- Early termination benefit outweighs inefficiency

**The problem:** Postgres lacks per-value statistics to know that TestUser has 0 issues. It only adapts when the **estimated** row count is very low based on general statistics, not actual data distribution.

## How Postgres Estimates Rows: MCV Lists vs Correlated Subqueries

### The Mystery Solved

Why does Postgres estimate accurately for `creatorID = 'test-user-123'` (1 row) but not for the EXISTS version (34,629 rows)?

**Answer:** Postgres uses **Most Common Values (MCV)** statistics for literal values, but falls back to general selectivity for correlated subqueries.

### Postgres Statistics for creatorID

```sql
SELECT most_common_vals, most_common_freqs, n_distinct
FROM pg_stats
WHERE tablename = 'issue' AND attname = 'creatorID';
```

**Results:**
```
most_common_vals:  {lHr1oe7FW0, QQOtciS-gZ, elvUJnNf7r, hpDTUMEJw7, FzHEjzbGL1, XtQju79aJj}
most_common_freqs: {0.19143334, 0.17033334, 0.1626, 0.1599, 0.15886667, 0.15686667}
n_distinct:        6
```

Postgres tracks the **exact frequency** of the most common values:
- `lHr1oe7FW0` (Naomi): 19.14% → ~46,403 rows
- `XtQju79aJj` (Clarissa): 15.69% → ~38,024 rows
- Other known creators: 15-17% each

### Row Estimation Comparison

#### 1. Direct Literal Value (Known in MCV)

```sql
WHERE "creatorID" = 'lHr1oe7FW0'  -- Naomi
```

**Plan:**
```
Index Scan using issue_created_idx
  Filter: (("creatorID")::text = 'lHr1oe7FW0'::text)
  rows=46403  -- Exact from MCV!
```

**How it works:**
1. Postgres sees literal value `'lHr1oe7FW0'`
2. Looks up in MCV list: frequency = 0.19143334
3. Calculates: 242,400 × 0.19143334 = **46,403 rows** (exact!)
4. Cost estimate: 145.75 (assumes early termination beneficial)

#### 2. Direct Literal Value (Unknown, NOT in MCV)

```sql
WHERE "creatorID" = 'test-user-123'  -- Not in database
WHERE "creatorID" = 'unknown-user-999'  -- Never existed
```

**Plan:**
```
Sort
  ->  Index Scan using issue_creatorid_modified_idx
        Index Cond: (("creatorID")::text = 'test-user-123'::text)
        rows=1  -- Default for unknown values!
```

**How it works:**
1. Postgres sees literal value `'test-user-123'`
2. NOT found in MCV list
3. Assumes rare/unknown value → estimates **1 row**
4. Cost estimate: 8.39 (filter first is better)
5. Chooses different plan!

#### 3. EXISTS Correlated Subquery

```sql
WHERE EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM "user"
  WHERE name = 'TestUser' AND "user".id = issue."creatorID"
)
```

**Plan:**
```
Nested Loop
  ->  Index Scan using issue_created_idx
        rows=242400  -- All rows!
  ->  Materialize
        ->  Seq Scan on "user"
              Filter: ((name)::text = 'TestUser'::text)
              rows=1
Join rows estimate: 34629  -- Generic calculation!
```

**How it works:**
1. Postgres plans the join **before knowing which creatorID**
2. Cannot look up specific value in MCV (value is unknown at plan time)
3. Uses generic selectivity: `1 / n_distinct = 1 / 6 = ~16.7%`
4. Estimates: 242,400 × (1/6) × (user rows / total users) ≈ **34,629 rows**
5. Cannot use MCV statistics for correlated joins!

#### 4. Scalar Subquery (InitPlan)

```sql
WHERE "creatorID" = (
  SELECT id FROM "user" WHERE name = 'TestUser'
)
```

**Plan:**
```
InitPlan 1 (returns $0)
  ->  Seq Scan on "user"
        Filter: ((name)::text = 'TestUser'::text)
        rows=1
Index Scan using issue_created_idx
  Filter: (("creatorID")::text = ($0)::text)
  rows=40400  -- Generic estimate! (1/6 of total)
```

**How it works:**
1. InitPlan executes subquery first, returns value to `$0`
2. But planner doesn't know what `$0` will be at plan time
3. Treats `$0` as unknown parameter
4. Uses generic selectivity: 242,400 / 6 ≈ **40,400 rows**
5. Still can't use MCV for parameterized values!

### The Key Insight

**Postgres MCV lookup only works for compile-time literal constants!**

| Query Pattern | Value Known at Plan Time? | Uses MCV? | Row Estimate |
|---------------|---------------------------|-----------|--------------|
| `creatorID = 'lHr1oe7FW0'` | ✅ Yes (literal) | ✅ Yes | 46,403 (exact) |
| `creatorID = 'test-user-123'` | ✅ Yes (literal) | ✅ Yes | 1 (not in MCV) |
| `creatorID = 'unknown-999'` | ✅ Yes (literal) | ✅ Yes | 1 (not in MCV) |
| EXISTS correlated | ❌ No (runtime join) | ❌ No | 34,629 (generic) |
| Scalar subquery `= ($0)` | ❌ No (runtime param) | ❌ No | 40,400 (generic) |

### Why Plans Differ

**For 'test-user-123' literal:**
- Looks up in MCV → not found
- Assumes rare value → estimates 1 row
- Plans: Filter first (8.39 cost) ✅

**For EXISTS with TestUser:**
- Cannot look up at plan time
- Uses generic selectivity (1/6)
- Estimates 34,629 rows
- Plans: Scan by created order (203.92 cost) ❌

**The paradox:** The same query with the same actual data produces different plans because:
- Literal value → MCV lookup possible → accurate estimate
- Runtime join → MCV lookup impossible → generic estimate

### Implications

1. **Prepared statements with parameters** also can't use MCV
2. **Joins** fundamentally prevent MCV lookup
3. **Only literal values** get accurate selectivity estimates
4. This is why ORMs and prepared statements often get suboptimal plans
5. Consider using literal values for critical filters when possible
