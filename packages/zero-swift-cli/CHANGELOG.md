# zero-swift

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- c7b53df: The CLI is built on [incur](https://github.com/wevm/incur). Errors print a code and a message and exit 1. `--json` prints results as JSON, `--llms` prints a manifest for coding agents, and `skills add` installs the commands as an agent skill. `codegen` has an option for every config key, such as `--type-prefix` and `--access`. The schema module option is now `--schema-file`, because incur reserves `--schema`; `--schema <path>` still works. The config keys are now documented in the README.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 5251897: `zero-swift --help` prints usage, and a missing schema, samples, or config file or an unknown option gets a one-line message instead of a stack trace.
