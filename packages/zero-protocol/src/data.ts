 * The data types that Zero can represent are limited by two things:
 *
 * 1. The underlying Replicache sync layer currently can only represent JSON
 *    types. This could possibly be expanded in the future, but we do want to be
 *    careful of adding encoding overhead. By using JSON, we are taking
 *    advantage of IndexedDBâ€™s fast native JSValue [de]serialization which has
 *    historically been a perf advantage for us.
 *
 * 2. IDs in Zero need to be comparable because we use them for sorting and row
 *    identity. We could expand the set of allowed value types (to include,
 *    i.e., Objects) but we would then need to restrict IDs to only comparable
 *    types.
 *
 * These two facts leave us with the following allowed types. Zero's replication
 * layer must convert other types into these for tables to be used with Zero.
 *
 * For developer convenience we also allow `undefined`, which we treat
 * equivalently to `null`.
