/**
 * There are two types of drains:
 * 1. Elective drains happen when a view-syncer is about to process
 *    a replication event and drains instead because {@link shouldDrain()}
 *    returned true. In this case, it exits its processing loop and
 *    calls {@link drainNextIn()} immediately.
 * 2. Force drains are performed by the Syncer, which picks a random
 *    view-syncer and calls {@link stop()}.
 *
 * In the case of a forced drain, the view-syncer may be queued up
 * behind a large amount of CPU-consuming events, and thus it may take
 * a long time before it actually stops. Elective drains are preferred because
 * they are less subject to that variance. However, elective drains only happen
 * if there is a task to be processed, so forced drains are still necessary
 * for draining servers with no work / tasks.
 *
 * The Syncer kicks off the drain process by calling {@link drainNextIn drainNextIn(0)},
 * which sets off a short {@link forceDrainTimeout} but starts returning `true` for
 * {@link shouldDrain()} for elective drains. In the latter case, the drained
 * view-syncer immediately exiting its processing loop and calls
 * {@link drainNextIn drainNextIn(myHydrationTime)} to reset the timeout
 * for the next elective or forced drain.
