/**
 * Because of subqueries, the output of Zero queries are trees, not sets like in
 * a normal database. Thus, fundamentally, the output of IVM must represent
 * changes to a *tree*.
 *
 * Because we care about minimizing memory consumption on the server, TreeDiff
 * is lazy. You donâ€™t get the entire tree of changes at once. Instead you
 * consume a TreeDiff by iterating it. As each Change comes out of a level of
 * TreeDiff, you gain access to "subdiffs" that represents the changes to each
 * subquery. These in turn are also lazy.
 *
 * TreeDiffs come either sorted or unsorted. If sorted, the sort is by the
 * sort of the query. The sort applies only to the the current level of the
 * tree. Subdiffs may be sorted or unsorted.
 *
 * Sorted TreeDiffs are useful because they allow us to stop consuming the
 * stream as soon as we have enough data. This is important for queries with
 * limits.
 *
 * Unsorted TreeDiffs are used when new data is pushed into the pipeline. In
 * this case, the data pushed in is not sorted - it's just in the order the
 * changes happened in. In this case, consumers must consume the entire stream
 * to ensure they have the complete state of the query.
 *
 * We enforce that unsorted TreeDiffs are completely consumed by making the
 * initial iterator that vends the data a 'needy' ChangeStream. See
 * ChangeStream for more information.
