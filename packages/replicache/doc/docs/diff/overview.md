# Diff Strategies

The Replicache protocol leaves a lot of flexibility in how servers can calculate the diff to return in the [pull endpoint](/reference/server-pull). This section summarizes some common strategies, and their tradeoffs.

Our general recommendation is to start with the [Global Version](/concepts/diff/global-version) strategy and move to [Row Versioning](/concepts/diff/row-version) when you need either increased flexibility or throughput.

            <td align="center">✅</td>
            <td>😅 Really just useful for understanding Replicache or for very tiny applications.</td>
            <td align="center" nowrap="true">👍🏼 Trivial</td>
            <td>👍🏼 Very flexible – supports deletes, auth changes automatically.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td align="center" nowrap="true"><a href="/concepts/diff/global-version"><b>🌏 Global Version</b></a></td>
            <td align="center">✅</td>
            <td>🤷🏻 Limits write throughput across application to about 50 pushes/second</td>
            <td align="center" nowrap="true">👍🏼 Trivial</td>
            <td>🤷🏻 Requires soft-deletes and special care to support auth changes and incremental sync.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td align="center" nowrap="true"><a href="/concepts/diff/per-space-version"><b>🛸 Per-Space Version</b></a></td>
            <td align="center">✅</td>
            <td>🤷🏻 Limits write throughput per-space to about 50 pushes/second</td>
            <td align="center" nowrap="true">🤷🏻 Moderately difficult</td>
            <td>😅 Same issues as global version, plus must partition data into spaces.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td align="center" nowrap="true"><a href="/concepts/diff/row-version"><b>🚣 Row Versioning</b></a></td>
            <td align="center">✅</td>
            <td>👍🏼 Increased read and write load in pull, but no contention anywhere so quite scalable</td>
            <td align="center" nowrap="true">😅 More difficult</td>
            <td>👍🏼 Very flexible – supports deletes, auth changes, and incremental sync easily.</td>
        </tr>
