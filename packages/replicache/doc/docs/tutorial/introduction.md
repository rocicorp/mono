This tutorial takes about 15 minutes, and will walk you through the basics of using Replicache. It runs in the browser so there’s nothing to install or setup.

The app you'll build is a counter that is synced across browsers.

Once you finish, your app will have these features:

- Realtime collaboration
- Instant (optimistic) mutations
- Rollback of optimistic UI when server mutations fail
- Offline support

You will also have a good understanding of Replicache's key concepts of

- Mutations
- Subscriptions
- Synchronization
