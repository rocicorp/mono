 *   - `disconnectAt` is the epoch timestamp when the client will transition to `disconnected` state
 *   - `reason` is the optional error associated with the connection attempt.
 * - `disconnected`: The client is now in an "offline" state. It will continue
 *   to try to connect every 5 seconds.
 * - `connected`: The client has opened a successful connection to the server.
 * - `error`: A fatal error occurred. No connection retries will be made until the host
 *   application calls `connect()` again.
 *   - `reason` is the `ZeroError` associated with the error state.
 * - `closed`: The client was shut down (for example via `zero.close()`). This is
 *   a terminal state, and a new Zero instance must be created to reconnect.
